They can touch your body
But they'll never touch your soul
They can try discredit every song you ever wrote
Those with bad intentions, they can't get the best of me
I don't pay them no attention
'Cause they, they just don't get it

I'm a free, I'm a free woman
Woman
I'm a free, I'm a free woman
Woman
You can take it all
You can cheer me as I fall
But you can't extinguish me
'Cause I'm a free woman
Free, free

May my body be of service
May my beauty be of use
As a vessel that I live in
Not an object to abuse
Those with bad intentions, they can't get the best of me
I don't pay them no attention
'Cause they, they just don't get it

I'm a free, I'm a free woman
Woman
I'm a free, I'm a free woman
Woman
You can take it all
You can cheer me as I fall
But you can't extinguish me
'Cause I'm a free woman
Free, free, free, free

In twenty years, my face will be a shadow of my youth
They'll try erase my wrinkles, yeah, they'll try erase my truth
But I've been here before
And that shit don't do anything to me anymore

I'm a free, I'm a free woman
Woman
I'm a free, I'm a free woman
Woman
I'll never let go
Of our freedom and our hope
'Cause I'm a free woman
Free, free, free, free
Free, free, free, free
I'm a free, I'm a free woman
Woman
I'm a free, I'm a free woman
Woman

I'll never let go
Of our freedom and our hope
You'll never extinguish me
'Cause I'm a free woman
