Life is a game that the universe plays
We are the pieces in a puzzle called fate
Life takes its time in its own fashion
Emotions unfold like a superbloom in action
The universe hangs like a necklace from God
Jewels suspended in the cosmos
And it makes me believe, this is how we're meant to be

'Cause we're just highly emotional people
And you don't need to hide
Sometimes it's hard to tell me how you feel
I never see you cry
I never see you cry

All of the weight you have carried around
Feelings come up and you push 'em back down
I feel your pain 'cause I know life is hard
But you can let go of the pain in your heart

'Cause we're just highly emotional people
And you don't need to hide
You know it's safe to tell me how you feel
I never see you cry
I never see you cry

People say men don't cry
It's so much easier to just lie
'Til somebody takes their life
Emotions are a part of our design

'Cause we're just highly emotional people
And you don't need to hide
Sometimes it's hard to tell me how you feel
I never see you cry
'Cause we're just highly emotional people
And you don't need to hide
You know it's safe to tell me how you feel
I never see you cry
I never see you cry

I never see you cry
