Everything that made you great only made you bad
Made the people hate all the good they had
I know that you had big dreams
That you had big plans
But abuse won't make
Won't make a free land

You got a white picket fence and your dad's got a gun
And when you see the police there's no reason to run
You got a job, and a car, and a good dental plan
You got health insurance, pocket money
Damn

America
America, America
You can't bury the truth
It's time to pay your dues
America
This is a new America
Stars are shining for you
Sparkling red and blue

Fucked with the food chain
Fucked with the farming too
And now our food don't taste
Like it's meant to do

They've got blood on their hands
'Cause they stole all the land
And all the lies they're here to raise
Made them feel like a man
Who gave you jazz, hip-hop, rock and roll, and the blues?
No matter what, the story's catching up on you

America
America, America
You can't bury the truth
It's time to pay your dues
America
This is a new America
Stars are shining for you
Sparkling red and blue

White teeth, dark smile
You've been in pain for a while
You can't hide your secrets we can see

America
America, America
You can't bury the truth
It's time to pay your dues
Stars are shining for you
'Cause freedom's sparkling soon (Oh)
America
This is a new America
Stars are shining for you (Oh)
Sparkling red and blue (Oh)
