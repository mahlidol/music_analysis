You almost turned me psycho
I almost lost my mind
I didn't know the depth yet
Of someone so unkind
Someone who was special
In every other way (Mm-mmh)
You damaged what we had
But for her it's just another day

You opened up Pandora's box
You don't know what you just unlocked
I lose all control
Let go of my darkest thoughts
'Cause I see the truth when we were stacked against the odds
And I pray that hope's not lost

I've escaped many vices
Like drugs and alcohol
But I can never escape
The war inside my skull
You know that love's a gift
But it can also be a curse (Mm-mmh)
Always the optimist
Dealing with somebody else's can of worms

You opened up Pandora's box
You don't know what you just unlocked
I lose all control
Let go of my darkest thoughts
'Cause I see the truth when we were stacked against the odds
And I pray that hope's not lost
I pray that hope's not lost

Yeah, I thought it would get better
I kept my hope alive
But I don't wanna be the bearer
Of pain just so we can survive
Mm-mmh, mm-mmh

You opened up Pandora's box
You don't know what you just unlocked
I lose all control
Let go of my darkest thoughts
'Cause I see the truth when we were stacked against the odds
And I pray that hope's not lost
I pray that hope's not lost

I pray that hope's not lost
I pray that hope's not lost
