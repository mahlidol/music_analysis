In the city of metal and sun
Angels and demons on the run
Empty boulevards shine like a gun
Swimming pools of people having fun

Walking like zombies in the night
Don't fear the apocalypse, 'cause we'll survive
Handbag shopping on Rodeo Drive
Believing Armani will keep us alive

I just wanna forget
How fucked up is our planet

Laughing all the time, driving in the sunshine
Pink convertible, living in the free world
We're so fucking blind, praying we'll be fine
We keep laughing all the time, driving in the sunshine

Sorry to the flowers and the trees
And the fish poisoned in the seven seas
The private jet looks cool on the 'Gram
40 pairs of Nikes, you're the man

Leave me alone with my luck and money
And I don't want to know that it's a time bomb, honey
Let me enjoy my lack of trouble
And nothing's going to burst my money bubble

We just wanna forget
How fucked up is our planet

Laughing all the time, driving in the sunshine
Pink convertible, living in the free world
We're so fucking blind, praying we'll be fine
We keep laughing all the time, driving in the sunshine

Let them eat cake and keep our engines running
Not even Marie Antoinette could see the end was coming
We party harder when there's no tomorrow
The time has come to help but now we're all falling like dominoes

Laughing all the time, driving in the sunshine
Pink convertible, living in the free world
We're so fucking blind, praying we'll be fine
We keep laughing all the time, driving in the sunshine
