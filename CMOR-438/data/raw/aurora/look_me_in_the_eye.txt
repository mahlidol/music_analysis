I put the man in the moon
I put the dial in the tone
I put the grease on the wheel
I put the sword in the stone
I lit the southern stars
I put the heathens peace
And then I hit the bird in the bush
And someone called the police

And I know you don't mean it
I know you don't mean it
I know you don't mean it
Because you can't

Turn around and look me in the eye
Turn around and look me in the eye
Turn around and say it to my face
Turn around and say it to my face

I got a wicked on
Let me stretch your ears
Put down your broomstick, baby
Gonna look like a witch
And I can feel the hole
In your memory
Sinking glasses over
And I'll show you things you can't unsee

And I know you don't mean it
I know you don't mean it
I know you don't mean it
Because you can't

Turn around and look me in the eye
Turn around and look me in the eye
Turn around and say it to my face
Turn around and say it to my face
