There ain't no words for the song I'm trying to write
No, there ain't no words for the song I'm trying to write
Oh, I just don't know the words, babe, for what I'm trying to write
Everything I've tried so far, babe, doesn't feel right
There ain't no words for the song I'm trying to play
No, there ain't no words for the song I'm trying to play
Oh, I just don't know the words, babe, for what I'm trying to say
If all I could do is hope that you don't take it the wrong way

If all I can do is say, "Don't take it the wrong way"

There ain't no words to the song I'm here to sing
No, there ain't no words to the song I came to sing
Oh, I just don't know the words, babe, to tell you what I mean
And I'm at the end of my mind trying to do the right thing

Oh, there ain't no words for what I'm trying to say
There just ain't the words for what I'm trying to say
