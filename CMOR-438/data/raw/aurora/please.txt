(Ah)

Please, I'm down on my knees
I have a family
Please, it's an awful disease
And it's getting me
Merged with a terrible urge every night
Please, if it's only a single bite

How is the terrible trees at the edge of it?
Please, man, I'm down on my knees like a Jesuit
And I need what I can't unsee to disappear
Now, c'mon, man, I don't wanna do in hell

Please, I'm the worst at this
I need you to say no, please

Please, let the man that you please
For the other guests
I take it out on myself
As a little test
Oh, at least, meet me under the table for a kiss
Oh, and please, know I'm better than all of this

Please, would you throw me a breeze for a little spot?
For him in the valley of death, it's a little hot
Please, see I'm better than this in advance
Oh, please, never give me a second chance

Please, I'm the worst at this
I need you to say no, please
