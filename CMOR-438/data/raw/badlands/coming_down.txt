I found God
I found him in a lover
When his hair falls in his face
And his hands so cold they shake

I found the Devil
I found him in a lover
And his lips like tangerines
And his color coded speak

Now we're lost somewhere in outer space
In a hotel room where demons play
They run around beneath our feet
We roll around beneath these sheets

I've got a lover
A love like religion
I'm such a fool for sacrifice
It's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down

I've got a lover
And I'm unforgiven
I'm such a fool to pay this price
It's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down

I found a martyr
He told me that I'd never
With his educated eyes
And his head between my thighs

I found the savior
I don't think he remembers
'Cause he's off to pay his crimes
And he's got no time for mine

Now we're lost somewhere in outer space
In a hotel room where demons play
They run around beneath our feet
We roll around beneath these sheets

I've got a lover
A love like religion
I'm such a fool for sacrifice
It's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down

I've got a lover
And I'm unforgiven
I'm such a fool to pay this price
It's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down

Every single night pray the sun'll rise
Every single time make a compromise
Every single night pray the sun'll rise, but

It's coming down, down, coming down
He's coming down, down, coming down

I've got a lover
A love like religion
I'm such a fool for sacrifice
It's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down

I've got a lover
And I'm unforgiven
I'm such a fool to pay this price
It's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down

Every single night pray the sun'll rise
Every single time make a compromise
Every single night pray the sun'll rise, but

It's coming down, down, coming down
He's coming down, down, coming down

It's coming down, down, coming down
He's coming down, down, coming down

It's coming down, down, coming down
He's coming down, down, coming down
