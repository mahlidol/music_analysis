We could be romantics for life
Go wild with our scars unhealed
Ooh, ooh
We could be romantics for life
Like drugs make us feel unreal
Ooh, ooh

Uh, uh, uh
A long way from home met this girl caught my sight
She walk in with a storm cloud, eyes like lightning
Hair like the sun, butterflies been risin'
Swayin' in the grass, then we probably should light it
Tell me, do you got the lighter that I gave ya?
Smoke a little somethin' 'til the doubt subsidin'
I don't wanna feel regret, just imagine (imagine)

We could be romantics for life
Go wild with our scars unhealed
Ooh, ooh
We could be romantics for life
Like drugs make us feel unreal
Ooh, ooh
(We could be romantics)

They talk a lot, don't they?
'Bout your life
They talk a lot, don't they?
Why, are you tired?
It's none of their business who we love
Drinking, destructive, kind, fill me up
Holding me down in my seat
Tell me, I know what you need
I know your head makes you lie, oh

'Cause we could be romantics for life
Go wild with our scars unhealed
Ooh, ooh
We could be romantics for life
Like drugs make us feel unreal (unreal)
Ooh, ooh

('Cause we could be)
We could be real
We could be real
(We could)
(Drugs make us feel)
We could be real
We could be real
We could be romantics
(Drugs make us feel, drugs make us feel unreal)

Autotune's really fun
