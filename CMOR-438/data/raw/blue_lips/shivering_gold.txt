A minute of truth time, talking 'bout stuff
Keep saying I'm danger, but thinking I'm love
I'm out on the dance floor, drinking my tears
Acting all cliché, and facing my fears

Curious minds; hearts pounding
Fingers in ties; wet, dripping
Curious minds; lips, lick 'em
Pupils grow wide

I feel that thing that jolts me, fucks with me good
Shivering gold, I shiver in gold
Wild, real; that thing’s like moon rocks rolled up in love
Shivering gold, I shiver in gold

Kissing it better, the physical phase
Take in your body, I sit on your face
I see you smiling, covered in me
Moving too fast now, but fuck it, we're free

Curious minds; hearts pounding
Fingers in ties; wet, dripping
Curious minds; lips, lick 'em
Pupils grow wide (wider)

I feel that thing that jolts me, fucks with me good
Shivering gold, I shiver in gold
Wild, real; that thing’s like moon rocks rolled up in love
Shivering gold, I shiver in gold

Shiver, shiver, bittersweet, that glitter
Shiver, shiver, bittersweet, that glitter
Shiver, shiver, bittersweet, that glitter
Shiver, shiver, bittersweet, that glitter

Curious minds; hearts pounding
Fingers in ties
Curious minds; lips, lick 'em
Pupils grow wide

I feel that thing that jolts me, fucks with me good
Shivering gold, I shiver in gold
Wild, real; that thing’s like moon rocks rolled up in love
Shivering gold, I shiver in gold

Shiver, shiver, bittersweet, that glitter
Shiver, shiver, bittersweet, that glitter
Shiver, shiver, bittersweet, that glitter
Shiver, shiver, bittersweet, that glitter
