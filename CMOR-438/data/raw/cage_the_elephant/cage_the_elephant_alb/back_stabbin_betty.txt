Poor guy, that man John Thomas
His woman truly was a devil
And she wasn't all that honest
She tore him down on every level

"You're a no-good, lazy motherfucker
Got a, a shit job, you worthless motherfucker
You're a, a deadbeat, feel sorry for your mother
If I, I had time, I'd trade you for another"

He don't like that, he wants his life back
He wants go back home

He tried so hard to please her
He sold his soul to keep her happy
But nothing he did impressed her
She always left him feeling shitty

"This is it? No, this can't be all you bought me"
Said, "I'm, I'm high class and this is where you brought me?
Gonna strike low just like my Mama taught me
You're a, a lowlife and lucky that you got me"

He don't like that, he wants his life back
He wants go back home

Down deep, way down inside him
The will to leave was growing stronger
And he bit his tongue for so long
He couldn't hold back any longer

"You're a two-faced, ruthless instigator
You're a, a low down, trifling masquerader
You're a, a cold bitch, controlling conversator
This is too much, I'm out, I'll see you later"

She don't like that, but he got his life back
No, she don't like that, but he's right back on track
I said he went back home
