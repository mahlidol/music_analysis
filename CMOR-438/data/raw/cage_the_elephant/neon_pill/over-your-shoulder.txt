Sea foam broke the sailor's mast
Constellations on his back
Watching his image ripple past
Just a drop, life moves fast

So, outta my head now, laying my head down
Don't look back over your shoulder
I'm not saying don't ask
When it feels like it gets colder
Every season will pass

Shouldn't have kissed the gunner's daughter
But in that moment, we were brothers
Walk the plank just like my mother
Long, long, long lost love lullaby, sing
Laying your head down
When you're laying your head down

Don't look back over your shoulder
I know it's not easy to ask
When it feels like it gets colder
Every season will pass

Believe me, I'm experienced
Believe me, I'm experienced
Don't look back over your shoulder
You don't need me to ask
If it feels like it gets colder
Every season will pass
