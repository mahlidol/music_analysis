Let's lay it out, lay it all on the table
Straight from the top, you called my hand, and I felt labeled
Saw the one past whispers that I hated
Trapped inside a mirror
Changing shapes to shake those labels

Soft crush, twin flame, bright lights, no shame, home base
Even when it's painful
You lift me up, all in, tight knit, second skin, won't quit
Satellite faithful, floating like a rainbow

You lift me up when I get down
Right 'round, got me floating like a rainbow
I need your touch, your touch right now
Right 'round, got me floating like a rainbow
And so this world keeps turning 'round
Right 'round, got me floating like a rainbow
You lift me up when I get down
Right 'round, got me floating like a rainbow
Floating like a rainbow

You are more vibrant than a technicolor flower bloom
Worth more than any sunset that I ever even knew
As far as east is to the west, there is no flaw in you
It's you I want, it's you I want, it's you I want, and only you

You lift me up, all in, tight knit, second skin, won't quit
Satellite faithful, floating like a rainbow

You lift me up when I get down
Right 'round, got me floating like a rainbow
I need your touch, your touch right now
Right 'round, got me floating like a rainbow
And so this world keeps turning 'round
Right 'round, got me floating like a rainbow
You lift me up when I get down, right 'round
Got me floating like a rainbow
Floating like a rainbow

The lights go out, and I'm back inside that hallway
Shadowboxing shame and self inflicted mind games
Burning the candle from both ends has got me sideways
Am I afraid to lose or more afraid to lose my way?

You lift me up when I get down
Right 'round, got me floating like a rainbow
I need your touch, your touch right now
You lift me up when I get down
You lift me up when I get down
Right 'round, got me floating like a rainbow
Floating like a rainbow

You lift me up when I get down
Right 'round, got me floating like a rainbow
I need your touch, your touch right now
Right 'round, got me floating like a rainbow
And so this world keeps turning 'round
Right 'round, got me floating like a rainbow
You lift me up when I get down, right 'round
Got me floating like a rainbow
Floating like a rainbow
