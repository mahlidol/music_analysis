It was lightning in a bottle, happened in a fraction
Gasping for a breath, smoke fresh everlasting
Just a glance, what's the chance?
Frantic in a bubble, classic move, play it cool
For an instant, it was magic

I don't wanna play those games
Will we ever be the same?
I don't wanna play those games
Will we ever be the same?
Same, same, same, same

When two bodies feel like quicksand
Pulse project vibrations
Asked me for my coat, and you give me your jacket
In my mind, yeah, you're mind
Spill another glass of wine
What's the move? Set the mood
For an instant, it was magic

I don't wanna play those games
Will we ever be the same?
I don't wanna play those games
Will we ever be the same?
Same, same, same, same

Did you ever stop to think about it?
Did you ever stop to think about it?
Did you ever stop to think about it?
Did you ever stop to think?

I don't wanna play those games
Will we ever be the same?
I don't wanna play those games
Will we ever be the same?
Same, same, same, same
