Take, take this broke, this broken heart
This heart of mine
Break, these chains are broken
Unclothe my eyes with waves of light

I've always been a fighter
These chains
But kept it out of sight, no lie
Caught in my emotions
Take these wrongs, make them right

What's behind those shy eyes, shy eyes?
Have I become a past time, passed by?
What's behind those shy eyes, shy eyes?
Shy eyes, shy eyes
You cut through my human condition
You cut through my human condition

Face to face, hiding right behind those eyes
Shake my disposition
Test my faith, bathed in light

What's behind those shy eyes, shy eyes?
Have I become a past time, passed by?
What's behind those shy eyes, shy eyes?
Shy eyes, shy eyes
You cut through my human condition
You cut through my human condition

Blooming flowers wake
Daylight's at the gate
Wherever I roam
My soul to take

I don't believe those shy eyes, shy eyes
I won't be just a past time, passed by
What's behind those shy eyes, shy eyes?
Shy eyes, shy eyes

What's behind those shy eyes, shy eyes?
Have I become a past time, passed by?
What's behind those shy eyes, shy eyes?
Shy eyes, shy eyes
You cut through my human condition
You cut through my human condition
You cut through my human condition
