Climb into my corner, my self inflicted coma
Stand up, lay down, repeat in the same order
Fall straight through the floor and let the time just run me over
Another mirrored image corrupted and distorted
I'm underwhelmed, uninterested, I wonder why I'm over it
Walk it off, the kettle's black
The dotted line, the house is glass

(The house is glass) The house is glass
(The house is glass) The house is glass

It's an illusion, this admiration
Of mutilation, my isolation
It's an illusion, this admiration
Of mutilation, my isolation, my isolation
My isolation, it's an illusion

Slide on down the staircase, that picture-perfect moment
Receiver projected, act like if you own it
Smile for the camera, repeat and do it over
Smile for the camera, repeat and do it over
Joke's on you, the needle prick
Cut me down, I need a break
Walk it off, the kettle's black
The dotted line, this house is glass

(The house is glass) The house is glass
(The house is glass) The house is glass

It's an illusion, this admiration
Of mutilation, my isolation
It's an illusion, this admiration
Of mutilation, my isolation, my isolation
My isolation, it's an illusion

Brick by brick
Make it last
Hit that line
The house is glass

It's an illusion, my isolation
My isolation, my isolation
It's an illusion, it's an illusion
My isolation, my isolation, my isolation
