Looking out my window at the city below
From my fancy hotel suite
Tell me where the wind blows, tell me how a heart knows
Where a soul can find some sleep

I can see the sunshine, breaking through the skyline
I can feel the warmth it brings
I can't help but stop and think

There's gotta be a place
Love's the only way
There's gotta be a place
Love's the only way
Love's the only way, oh

Never made the wind blow, never made a heart grow
Never made a dove take flight
Never made the sun rise, still can't get my heart right
Only ever made mistakes

So I can see the sunshine, breaking through the skyline
I can feel the warmth it brings
I can't help but stop and think

There's gotta be a place
Love's the only way
There's gotta be a place
Love's the only way
Love's the only way, oh

Look out for yourself, it's all the rage
You make up the rules or so they claim
One day you'll find life's not a game
It's not the wave that moves the sea
But the sea that moves the wave

There's gotta be a place
Love's the only way
There's gotta be a place
Love's the only way
Love's the only name
Love's the only way
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
