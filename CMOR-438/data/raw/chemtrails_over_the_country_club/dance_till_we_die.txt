I'm covering Joni and I'm dancing with Joan
Stevie is calling on the telephone
Court almost burned down my home
But God, it feels good not to be alone

But sometimes, this ranch feels like my only friend
And life doesn't always work out like we planned
We keep it moving, babe

So we made it back in the middle of the night
To the Louisiana two-step, high and bright
And we won't say when, we won't ask why
We won't stop dancing 'til we die
We'll keep walking on the sunny side
And we won't stop dancing 'til we die

Troubled by my circumstance
Burdened by the weight of fame
Clementine's not just a fruit
It's my daughter's chosen name

And when all the bars close down tonight
There's one that stays open just for us, alright
We keep dancing, babe

So we made it back in the middle of the night (We keep dancing, babe)
To the Louisiana two-step, high and bright (We keep it moving, babe)
And we won't say when, we won't ask why
We won't stop dancing 'til we die
We'll keep walking on the sunny side
And we won't stop dancing 'til we die

I went down to Woodside
I left Berkeley, out of city, out of mind
Killing it, talking shit, Joan said she was gonna quit
Tearing it up at the Afro-Caribbean two-step
I left San Francisco
I've been covering Joni and I'm dancing with Joan
It's kinda hard to find love
When you're used to rolling like a rolling stone

So we made it back in the middle of the night (We keep it moving, babe)
To the Louisiana two-step, high and bright (We keep dancing, babe)
And we won't say when, we won't ask why
We won't stop dancing 'til we die
We'll keep walking on the sunny side
And we won't stop dancing 'til we die
And we won't stop dancing 'til we die
