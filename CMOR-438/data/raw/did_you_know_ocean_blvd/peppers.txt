Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie
Hands on your knees, Angelina Jolie
Lemme put my hands on your knees, you can braid my hair
Do a fat criss cross in the back somewhere, ha

Me and my boyfriend listen to the Chili Peppers
We write hit songs without trying like all the time, all the time
I take off all my clothes, dance naked for the neighbors
I'm like, "Fuck it, gonna give a show", I open up the blinds

I threw caution to the wind, get on to the bike
Take a minute to yourself, skinny dip in my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love
Got a knife in my jacket, honey, I'm divine
Baby, I'll bring the coffee if you bring the wine
I'm in love, I'm in love
Ah

Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie
Hands on your knees, Angelina Jolie
Lemme put my hands on your knees, you can braid my hair
Do a fat criss cross in the back somewhere, ha
Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie
Hands on your knees, Angelina Jolie
Lemme put my hands on your knees, you can braid my hair
Do a fat criss cross in the back somewhere, ha

I sit upskirt, I don't have much to lose
I got a truck, I take it for a midnight, a midnight drive, yeah
My boyfriend tested positive for COV-, it don't matter
We've been kissing, so whatever he has, I have
I can't cry

I threw caution to the wind, get on to the bike
Take a minute for myself, skinny dip in my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love
Ah

Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie
Hands on your knees, Angelina Jolie
Lemme put my hands on your knees, you can braid my hair
Do a fat criss cross in the back somewhere, ha

I don't know maybe we should do something like..like merge this
Song.. you know that song..wipeout, yeah..dance type of song..like merge this
Song..Where it's like..You know that type of song
Wipeout, wipeout

Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie

Lemme put my hands on your knees, you can braid my hair
Do a fat criss cross in the back somewhere, ha
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
