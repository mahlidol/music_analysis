(Call on me)
Call on me
Call on me

Lay under the stars
All dusted in love
I grab your chain dangling from above
I always want it
You're never boring
Let's slip the magic into water cups

I got nothing to lose
Take me home with you
Let my body rule (Aha-ah), oh
I got nothing to hide
I'm putting my guard down
Bring me back to life (Aha-ah), oh

Call on me, I'd die for you, baby
Believe in love at night when you save me
Call on me, you know that I want it
I'll keep on coming back for your body

Call on me
Call on me
Feel your body call on me
Call on me
Feel your body call on me

We're watching 'em dance
Don't look at your hands
Just feel my sweat drip down your naked chest
Hallucinating
Infatuated
I let them take me (Aha-ah)

Call on me, I'd die for you, baby
Believe in love at night when you save me
Call on me, you know that I want it
I keep on coming back for your body

Call on me
Call on me
Feel your body call on me
Call on me
Feel your body call on me

I got nothing to lose
Take me home with you
Let my body rule (Aha-ah), oh
I got nothing to hide
I'm putting my guard down
Bring me back to life (Aha-a), oh

Call on me, I'd die for you, baby
Believe in love at night when you save me
Call on me, you know that I want it
I keep on coming back for your body

Call on me
Call on me
Feel your body call on me
Call on me
Feel your body call on me
