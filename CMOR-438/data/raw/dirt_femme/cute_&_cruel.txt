Love can be cute and cruel
Love is an animal
Love can be weak and strong
It's how you break your heart

Love is a feeling
Love is the meaning
Love can forgive a lot
It's why we go on at all

What is love?
How do you know?
Is it the way that all my feelings get blown up?
Is it real
Or delusional?
To want it powerful but never lose control

Stand in a crowd
The people are loud
But we got our own dimension
I know you know
And you know I know
We both got the same intention
Take in the room
The people go poof
And there's only us
Wanting my life
To be this wild
Is that real love?

Love can be cute and cruel
Love is an animal
Love can be weak and strong
It's how you break your heart

Love is a feeling
Love is the meaning
Love can forgive a lot
It's why we go on at all

What is true
When I'm in pain
When I get destructive and I ruin things again?
Do you stay
Or is it all on me
To fix the curve on how love ends statistically?

Stand in a crowd
The people are loud
But we got our own dimension
I know you know
And you know I know
We both got the same intention
Take in the room
The people go poof
And there's only us
Wanting my life
To be this wild
Is that real love?

Love can be cute and cruel
Love is an animal
Love can be weak and strong
It's how you break your heart

Love is a feeling
Love is the meaning
Love can forgive a lot
It's why we go on at all

Stand in our broken past
Our feelings out on the floor
How do we heal from that
We got to let it go

Ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh ooh

Yeah, love can be cute and cruel
Love is an animal
Love can be weak and strong
It's how you break your heart

Love is a feeling
Love is the meaning
Love can forgive a lot
It's why we go on at all

Love can be cute and cruel
Love is an animal
Love can be weak and strong
It's how you break your heart

Love is a feeling
Love is the meaning
Love can forgive a lot
It's why we go on at all
