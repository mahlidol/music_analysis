Feelings change, winter comes
Now your heart's colder than stone
Leaving me outside
I can't face what I know
Pulling us apart is all I'm good for
Left our love to die

I have hope
Am I wrong?
Is part of us still
A part still alive?

Feelings change, winter comes
Now your heart's colder than stone
Leaving me outside
I'm to blame all along
Kept my own coat of ice on
Left our love to die

I have hope
Am I wrong?
Is part of us still
A part still alive?

Why do you leave me to wonder
If this is worth fighting for?
Know I deserve what's coming
But after the pain is there more

Why do you leave me to wonder
If this is worth fighting for?
Know I deserve what's coming
But after the pain is there more

Feelings change, winter comes
Now your heart's colder than stone
Leaving me outside
I'm to blame all along
Kept my own coat of ice on
Left our love to die

Feelings change, winter comes
Now your heart's colder than stone
Leaving me outside
I'm to blame all along
Kept my own coat of ice on
Left our love to die

I have hope
Am I wrong?
Is part of us still
A part still alive?

Feelings change, you let go
No, you can't help where we are
Leaving me outside
I can't face what I know
Pulling us apart is all I'm good for
Left our love to die
