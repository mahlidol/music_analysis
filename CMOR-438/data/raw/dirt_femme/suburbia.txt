Now here I am with you
I never wanted babies
I know they're kinda cute
I never wanted marriage

But here I am with you
We love to live in chaos
There's nothing in our way
Our love is deep but fragile

No fake grass
No fake friends
That's our plan
Yeah, that's our future dance
No pretend
No safe end
That's our plan
No circumstance

I-I don't want suburbia
I don't need routines and lies
I hope you know that I know
You are the love of my life
But I-I-I can't be no Stepford wife

Just let me talk this through
So, if we had a baby
You'd love them more than me?
What if I'm way too lazy
For the mom olympic team?
Will we still be romantic?
Will I still get my sleep?
Will you be less pedantic?

No fake grass
No fake friends
That's our plan
Yeah, that's our future dance
No pretend
No safe end
That's our plan
No circumstance

I-I don't want suburbia
I don't need routines and lies
I hope you know that I know
You are the love of my life
But I-I-I can't be no Stepford wife (Ohh)

Mmm, mmm mmm mmm
Mmm, mmm mmm mmm
Mmm, mmm mmm mmm
Mmm, mmm mmm mmm

What if I change my mind and want one
But then I can't have none?
Would you leave me then?
What if I don't want the things I'm supposed to want?
What then?
But what if I do in the end?

I-I don't want suburbia (No-o)
I don't need routines and lies (I don't need no lies)
I hope you know that I know (I know)
You are the love of my life
But I-I-I can't be no Stepford wife (Oh no)
I hope you know that I know
You are the love of my life
But I-I-I can't be no Stepford wife
