Rule number one is that you gotta have fun
But baby when you're done, you gotta be the first to run
Rule number two: just don't get attached to,
Somebody you could lose
So le-let me tell you

This is how to be a heart-breaker
Boys they like a little danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger, a player
Singing I lo-lo-love you

How to be a heart-breaker
Boys they like the look of danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger, a player
Singing I lo-lo-love you
At least I think I do!

'Cause I lo-lo-lo-love you

Rule number three: wear your heart on your cheek
But never on your sleeve, unless you wanna taste defeat
Rule number four: gotta be looking pure
Kiss him goodbye at the door and leave him wanting more-more

This is how to be a heart-breaker
Boys they like a little danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger, a player
Singing I lo-lo-love you

How to be a heart-breaker
Boys they like the look of danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger, a player
Singing I lo-lo-love you
At least I think I do!

'Cause I lo-lo-lo-love you

Girls, we do whatever it will take
'Cause girls don't want, we don't want our hearts to break
In two, so it's better to be fake
Can't risk losing in love again babe

This is how to be a heart-breaker
Boys they like a little danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger, a player
Singing I lo-lo-love you

How to be a heart-breaker
Boys they like the look of danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger, a player
Singing I lo-lo-love you

'Cause I lo-lo-lo-love you
At least I think I do!
