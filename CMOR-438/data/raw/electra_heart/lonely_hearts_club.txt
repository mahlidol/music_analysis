Laugh track on a TV show, echoes in the dark alone
I go to bed feeling bad, that I'm the reason that you're sad
January to December, do you wanna be a member?

Lonely hearts club...
Do you want to be with somebody like me? Oh
Lonely hearts club...
Do you want to be with somebody like me? Oh

I feel like if I'm too kind then you will only change your mind
Take advantage of my heart and I'll go back into the dark
Love will never be forever, feelings are just like the weather
January to December, do you want to be a member?

Lonely hearts club...
Do you want to be with somebody like me? Oh
Lonely hearts club...
Do you want to be with somebody like me? Oh

Somebody like me, somebody like me, somebody like me?

Lonely hearts club...
Do you want to be with somebody like me? Oh
Lonely hearts club...
Do you want to be with somebody like me? Oh
Lonely hearts club...
Do you want to be with somebody like me? Oh
Do you want to be with somebody like me? Oh
Lonely hearts club...
Do you want to be with somebody like me? Oh
