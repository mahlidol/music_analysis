Monday morning you sure look fine
Friday I got travelin' on my mind
First you love me, and then you fade away
I can't go on believin' this way
I got nothing but love for you
So tell me what you really wanna do
First you love me then you get on down the line
But I don't mind
I don't mind

I'll be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind

Monday morning you sure look fine
Friday I got travelin' on my mind
First you love me then you say it's wrong
You know I can't go on believin' for long
But you know it's true
You only want me when I get over you
First you love me then you get on down the line
But I don't mind
No, I don't mind

I'll be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind
