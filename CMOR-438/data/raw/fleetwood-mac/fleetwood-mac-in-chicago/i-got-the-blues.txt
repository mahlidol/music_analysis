I got the blues I’ve got to pack my trunk and go
I got the blues I’ve got to pack my trunk and go
I've got a feeling you don't love me honey ain't that a crying shame?
Hey baby I want you to hold me tight you know

I can't even gun and butter but I feel myself sinking down
Honey what is wrong with you?
You know that I can't do nothing right
I just want you to act like I’ve got to go baby

What have you done to me?
Came talking your stuff
Want you to get a second time the rail's in the hole baby
Honey honey honey please come on home
I want to watch pretty baby till we are done
