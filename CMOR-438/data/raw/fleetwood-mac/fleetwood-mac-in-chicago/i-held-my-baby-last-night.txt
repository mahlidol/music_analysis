I held my baby last night, until everything was alright
I held my baby last night, until everything was alright
She woke up early this morning
She said baby, everything was alright

She said daddy daddy, please come back to me
Would you please come back to me
Daddy Daddy, love you baby
And I swear your love is free

Now here it's three o'clock in the morning
And my baby she ain't come home
(I'm gonna jump on you girl)
Yeah! No my baby she ain't come home!
Don't tell me nothing
I know that something is going on wrong
