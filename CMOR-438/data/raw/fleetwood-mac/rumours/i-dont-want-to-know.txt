I don't wanna know the reasons why
Our love keeps right on walking on down the line
I don't wanna stand 'tween you and love, honey
I just want you to feel fine

I don't wanna know the reasons why
Our love keeps right on walking on down the line
I don't wanna stand 'tween you and love, honey
I just want you to feel fine

Finally baby
The truth has come down now
Take a listen to your spirit
It's crying out loud

Try to believe
You say you love me, but you don't know
You got me rocking and a-reeling

I don't wanna know the reasons why
Our love keeps right on walking on down the line
I don't wanna stand 'tween you and love, honey
I just want you to feel fine

I don't wanna know the reasons why
Our love keeps right on walking on down the line
I don't wanna stand 'tween you and love, honey
I just want you to feel fine

Finally baby
The truth has been told
Now you tell me that I'm crazy
It's nothing that I didn't know

Trying to survive
You say you love me, but you don't know
You got me rocking and a-reeling
Hanging onto you

I don't wanna know the reasons why
Our love keeps right on walking on down the line
I don't wanna stand 'tween you and love, honey, take a little time

Oh, I don't wanna know
