[Lindsey Buckingham:]
If you wake up and don't want to smile
If it takes just a little while
Open your eyes and look at the day
You'll see things in a different way

[Buckingham and C. McVie:]
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be here better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

[Christine McVie:]
Why not think about times to come?
And not about the things that you've done?
If your life was bad to you
Just think what tomorrow will do

[Buckingham and C. McVie:]
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be here better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

[Buckingham and C. McVie:]
All I want is to see you smile
If it takes just a little while
I know you don't believe that it's true
I never meant any harm to you

[Buckingham and C. McVie:]
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be here better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

[Buckingham and C. McVie:]
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be here better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

[Buckingham and C. McVie:]
Don't you look back
Don't you look back
Don't you look back
Don't you look back
