Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
She rules her life like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?

All your life you've never seen
Woman, taken by the sky
Where would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Would you even try?

He says Rhiannon, don't go
And he says Rhiannon, stay
He says,"I still cry out for you

"Don't leave me"
"Don't leave me"

Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
She rules her life like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?
All your life you've never seen
Woman, taken by the sky
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Would you even try?
She is like a cat in the dark
And then she is the darkness
She rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless
All your life you've never seen
Woman taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Would you even try?
Would you even try?

Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon

She rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
She rules her life like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?
All your life you've never seen
Woman taken by the sky
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Would you even try?
Would you even try?

Rhiannon

Rhiannon

Dreams unwind
Love's a state of mind
Dreams unwind
Love's a state of mind

Your dreams unwind and still it's hard to find. I know
Dreams unwind and still it's a state of mind

Your dreams unwind and still it's hard to find, I know
Dreams unwind and still it's a state of mind, I know

Take me like the wind, child
Take me with the sky
Take me now

Take me like the wind
Take me with the sky
All the same all the same, Rhiannon
All the same, all the same

And he still cries out for her
"Don't leave me now"
