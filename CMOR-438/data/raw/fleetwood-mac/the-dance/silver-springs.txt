You could be my silver springs
Blue-green colors flashin'
I would be your only dream
Your shining autumn, ocean crashing
And did you say she was pretty?
And did you say that she loves you?
Baby, I don't wanna know

I'll begin not to love you
Turn around, see me runnin'
I said I loved you years ago
Tell myself you never loved me, no
And did you say she was pretty?
And did you say that she loves you?
Baby, I don't wanna know
Oh, no
And can you tell me was it worth it?
Really, I don't wanna know

Time cast its spell on you, but you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you, but you would not let me

Time cast its spell on you, but you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you, but you would not let me
I'll follow you down 'til the sound of my voice will haunt you
You'll never get away from the sound of the woman that loved you

I'll follow you down 'til the sound of my voice will haunt you
(Was I just a fool?)
You'll never get away from the sound of the woman that loved you
(Was I just a fool?)

I'll follow you down 'til the sound of my voice will haunt you
(Give me just a chance)
You'll never get away from the sound of the woman that loved you

You could be my silver springs
My blue-green colors flashing
