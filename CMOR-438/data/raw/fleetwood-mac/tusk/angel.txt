Sometimes the most beautiful things
The most innocent things
And many of those dreams pass us by
Keep passing me by

You feel good
I said, "It's funny that you understood.
I knew you would.
When you were good,
You were very, very good."

So I close my eyes softly
'Til I become that part of the wind
That we all long for sometime
Yeah

And to those that I love
Like a ghost through a fog
Like a charmed hour and a haunted song
And the angel of my dreams
Angel of my dreams

He said, "You feel good,"
I said, "It's funny that you understood.
I knew you would.
When you were good, baby.
Mmm, you were very good."

I still look up
When you walk in the room
I've the same wide eyes
Now they tell a story

I try not to reach out
When you turn around
You say, "Hello,"
And we both pretend
No great pretender

So I close my eyes softly
'Til I become that part of the wind
That we all long for sometime
Yeah

And to those that I love
Like a ghost through a fog
Like a charmed hour and a haunted song
And the angel
Angel of my dreams

Angel of my dreams

I still look up
Ooh, yeah
I try hard not to look up
Ooh, yeah

That girl was me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Track a ghost through the fog
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

A charmed hour and a haunted song
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Track a ghost through the fog, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You track a ghost through the fog, baby

Ooh, you try hard, but you'll never catch me
Yeah
But that girl was free
I want you to...
