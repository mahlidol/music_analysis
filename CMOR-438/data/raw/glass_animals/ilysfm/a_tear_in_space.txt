Love
Do you want love? Do you want lust?
You say you don't know
Maybe you just like the control
Like it all cold but I like you, like you like your drugs
You sit in my blood, maybe too much
Never enough
I am your dog, I'm on your floor
All that you want but I like you, like you like your drugs

You get all worked up
Loving you but it's not enough
Loving you from the airlock of
Your heart from Airlock One
Fear pulls you from my arms
It's a reckless abandon
One look and it's all gone
All the air from the bottom of my lungs

Water, running down my face
Water, running different ways
Water, like a billion waves
Water, just a tear in space
Water, running down my face
Water, running different ways
Water, like a billion waves
Water, just a tear in space

Ooh, too late my love
You blew me into star dust
Ooh, but I made it, just
Dangling like a thread from you

I climb into your walls
I'm where the spiders go
I'm here but you aren't sure
What are you waiting for?
Stretch me like leather rope
Make me invisible
Shape me into your form
What are you waiting for?

Hostage, so in love
It's an airless black chasm
You turn the airlock on
You turn the airlock on
Object disappearance
It's a true phenomenon
Forget me and I'm gone
I'm slipping, no no no no no

Water, running down my face
Water, running different ways
Water, like a billion waves
Water, just a tear in space
Water, running down my face
Water, running different ways
Water, like a billion waves
Water, just a tear in space
