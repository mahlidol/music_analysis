Save me now, close the door
Put on a sit-com and stare at my toes
I've had enough of today's emotions
Why can't they just leave me alone

Am I acting normal? Am I being fun?
Am I being everything all at once?
Did I say too little? Did I say too much?
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs!

You get lost in the ocean
What do you do, when you are so broken?
The flood, the feeling comes over
How are you so loved and so lonesome?
You get lost in the ocean
But you know I'd do anything for you
Babe, and now I'm here and I'm hoping
For sun in the afternoon

Chew me up, stub me out
Heel-press me down into the ground
It's the third time that I showered today
Fog on the glass where I drew something

Up comes the water, can't see the coast
My heart is dragging on the ocean floor
Laughing and crying, staring at my lunch
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs!

You get lost in the ocean
What do you do, when you are so broken?
The flood, the feeling comes over
How are you so loved and so lonesome?
You get lost in the ocean
But you know I'd do anything for you
Babe, and now I'm here and I'm hoping
For sun in the afternoon

My monologue's out of control
I found the hole where the happiness goes
Lump in my throat and a throat in my tongue
I'm going to scream at the top of my lungs!

You get lost in the ocean
What do you do, when you are so broken?
The flood, the feeling comes over
How are you so loved and so lonesome?
You get lost in the ocean
But you know I'd do anything for you
Babe, and now I'm here and I'm hoping
For sun in the afternoon

For sun in the afternoon
For sun in the afternoon

You get lost in the ocean
What do you do, when you are so broken?
The flood, the feeling comes over
How are you so loved and so lonesome?
You get lost in the ocean
But you know I'd do anything for you
Babe, and now I'm here and I'm hoping
For sun in the afternoon
