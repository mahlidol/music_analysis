White roses in the red dirt
You said, "It's so beautiful it hurts."
And I knew it and my heart burst
I said was beautiful at first
But

White roses in the red dirt
You said it's so beautiful it hurts
And I knew it and my heart burst
You're so much more than I deserve
But

Long ago
Probably in a galaxy not far from home
I bet there's a version where we're happier
And I didn't have to find a way to go
Oh wouldn't that be lovely?
You would torture me
Whisper me reasons that you hated me
Say it in the way that makes my knees go weak
And let me dangle from you like a piece of meat
Oh wouldn't that be lovely?

But I think we're formed from old Lego
In a bedside drawer where the stray things go
And I think we're formed from old Play-Doh
That you stole one night from a corner store
And

White roses in the red dirt
You said, "It's so beautiful it hurts."
And I knew it and my heart burst
I said was beautiful at first
But

One day you'll move on
Put me in a drawer
I'll just be a ghost in photos on your phone
And you'll see a sunny side:
Shows I never liked
You can put them on
Put the clap track in you life

'Cause I lose all your socks
I tremble when I talk
I veer left when I walk
Really? This is what you want?
'Cause you'll find a better one
Someone functional
And slowly I'll dissolve
Into echoes in your walls

But I think we're formed from old Lego
In a bedside drawer where the stray things go
And I think we're formed from old Play-Doh
That you stole one night from a corner store
And

White roses in the red dirt
You said, "It's so beautiful it hurts."
And I knew it and my heart burst
I said was beautiful at first
But

White roses in the red dirt
You said, "It's so beautiful it hurts."
And I knew it and my heart burst
You're so much more than I deserve
But

I'm a dreamer too
I'm a dreamer too
Paint over the sad bits
I know you that you do
'Cause
Mm, everlasting in a different moon
There's a perfect side to me and you

White roses in the red dirt
You said, "It's so beautiful it hurts."
I knew it and my heart burst
I said was beautiful at first
But

White roses in the red dirt
You said, "It's so beautiful it hurts."
And I knew it and my heart burst
You're so much more than I deserve
