Well King Midas put his hands on me again
He said "one day I'd realize why I don't have any friends"
I find myself alone at night
Unless I'm having sex
But he can make me golden if I just show some respect

But I don't let him touch me anymore
I said "I'm not something to butter up
And taste when you get bored
'Cause I have spent too many nights on dirty bathroom floors
To find some peace and quiet right behind a wooden door"

He said "please don't go away"
He said "please don't go away"
I said "it's too late"
I said "it's too late"
He said "please don't go away"
He said "please don't go away"
I said "it's too late"
I said "it's too late"

And now I can't stop thinking that I can't stop thinking
That I almost gave you everything
And now the whole thing's finished and I can't stop wishing
That I never gave you anything

You wrote 100 letters just for me
And I find them in my closet in the pockets of my jeans
Now I'm constantly reminded of the time I was 19
Every single one's forgotten in a laundromat machine

But I don't let him touch me anymore
I said "I'm not something to butter up
And taste when you get bored
'Cause I have spent too many nights on dirty bathroom floors
To find some peace and quiet right behind a wooden door"

He said "please don't go away"
He said "please don't go away"
I said "it's too late"
I said "it's too late"
He said "please don't go away"
He said "please don't go away"
I said "it's too late"
I said "it's too late"

And now I can't stop thinking that I can't stop thinking
That I almost gave you everything
And now the whole thing's finished and I can't stop wishing
That I never gave you anything
And then I can't stop thinking that I can't stop thinking
That I almost gave you everything (I said it's too late)
And now the whole thing's finished and I can't stop wishing
That I never gave you anything

He said "please don't go away"
He said "please don't go away"
I said "it's too late"
I said "it's too late"
He said "please don't go away"
He said "please don't go away"
I said "it's too late"
I said "it's too late"
