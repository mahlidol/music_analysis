Alone out in Saint-Tropez
Lookin' as fine as a damn Monet
Tryna hydrate on Perrier
Everybody thirsty, drinks on me
When I'm out, clothes on lay away
Tryna take back what you say to me
I don't give a damn what you say to me
There ain't no time for games with me

I'm moving on
I'm getting paid
I'm on my own
I had some space to deal with it
I'm moving on
It's getting late
Go and grab someone and find a place to deal with it

Yeah, don't even try
Can't fuck up my vibe
Double cuppin' in the ride
Motherfucker, don't play with me
Motherfucker, don't play with me
Motherfucker, don't play with me
Motherfucker, don't play with me

Runnin' lines like a marathon
Got it all white like Parmesan
I am not the type to be out past dawn
Tomorrow got a flight headed to Taiwan
Now you know where the bottle gone
Drippin' so wet with the Pérignon
I am not the type to admit I'm on
How could I lie when we sip so strong

I'm moving on
I'm getting paid
I'm on my own
I had some space to deal with it
I'm moving on
It's getting late
Go and grab someone and find a place to deal with it

Yeah, don't even try
Can't fuck up my vibe
Double cuppin' in the ride
Motherfucker, don't play with me
Motherfucker, don't play with me
Motherfucker, don't play with me
Motherfucker, don't play with me
