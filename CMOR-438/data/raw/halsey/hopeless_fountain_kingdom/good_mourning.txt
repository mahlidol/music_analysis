They told me once, "there's a place where love conquers all"
A city with the streets full of milk and honey
I haven't found it yet, but I'm still searching
All I know is a hopeless place that flows with the blood of my kin
Perhaps hopeless isn't a place
Nothing but a state of mind
They told me once, "don't trust the moon, she's always changing"
The shores bend and break for her
And she begs to be loved
But nothing here is as it seems

Sun is coming up oh, why, oh, why, oh, why...
Sun is coming up oh, why, oh, why, oh, why...
Sun is coming up oh, why, oh, why, oh, why...
Sun is coming up oh, why, oh, why, oh, why...
Sun is coming up oh, why, oh, why, oh, why...
Sun is coming up oh, why, oh, why, oh, why...
Sun is coming up oh, why, oh, why, oh, why...
