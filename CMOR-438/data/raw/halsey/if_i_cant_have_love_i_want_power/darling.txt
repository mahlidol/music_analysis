Really can't remember where I left my spine
Carrying my body in a bag for dimes
Hidden in the pages of the New York Times at home

Maybe I'll be better if I take my meds
Ain't a double header if you lose your head
Tried a medication that I bought instead
It's working for a little but there's not much left

Darling don't you weep
There's a place for me
Somewhere we can sleep
See you in your dreams

Ever since a little girl I found it sweet
Driving past a graveyard on a lonesome street
All the little flowers gave me something to believe in

Never knew the feeling of a stable home
Been a couple years of living on the road
Couldn't really tell you where they'd leave a stone
To visit me when I am dead and gone

Darling don't you weep
There's a place for me
Somewhere we can sleep
See you in your dreams

Darling don't you cry
Head fast toward the light
Foolish men have tried
But only you have shown me how to love being alive

Until it's time to see the light
I'll make my own with you each night
I'll kidnap all the stars and I will keep them in your eyes
I'll wrap them up in velvet twine
And hang them from a fishing line
So I can see them any time I'd like

Darling don't you weep
There's a place for me
Somewhere we can sleep
I'll see you in your dreams

Darling don't you cry
Head fast toward the light
Foolish men have tried
But only you have shown me how to love being alive
