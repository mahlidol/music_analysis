She told me "Open your mouth"
She said "I've got a surprise"
And so I opened it wide
And then she crawled inside
She's on the tip of my tongue
She's on the top of my thighs
And if I searched a thousand miles I'd be dying to find

Between my fingers
She leaves then she lingers
If she's gonna go
Well then I'm going with her
I know that I won't forget

She was sweet like honey
But all I can taste is the blood in my mouth
And the bitterness in goodbye
Dripping like honey
Down the back of my throat and out the front of my mind
And now she's impatient and I'm complacent
With just a little taste of wasting time
Looking for honey
But she stings like she means it
She's mean and she's mine

Out and about
Without a reason or rhyme
And now she's dancing on a table
And she spins on a dime
She's hell in a basket, just making a racket
I love every second, it's fucking fantastic
Good things aren't easy to get
I know that I won't regret

She was sweet like honey
And all I can taste is the blood in my mouth
And the bitterness in goodbye
Dripping like honey
Down the back of my throat and on the front of my mind
And well she's impatient and I'm complacent
With just a little taste of wasting time
Looking for honey
But she stings like she means it
She's mean and she's mine

Between my fingers
She leaves then she lingers
If she's gonna go
Well then I'm going with her
And I know that I won't forget

She was sweet like honey
But all I can taste is the blood in my mouth
And the bitterness in goodbye
Dripping like honey
Down the back of my throat and on the front of my mind
And well she's impatient and I'm complacent
With just a little taste of wasting time
Looking for honey
But she stings like she means it
She's mean and she's mine
