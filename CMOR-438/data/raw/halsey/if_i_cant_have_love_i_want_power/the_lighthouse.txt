From a tender age I was cursed with rage
Came swinging like a fist inside a batting cage
I went swimming with the devil at the bottom of a lake
And he left me there by my lonesome

He was tall and mean with venom eyes so green
Wanted reconciliation, but my tongue was in my teeth
And I couldn't find the floor so I was kickin with my feet
But they weren't there, they were stolen

There is a lighthouse in the
Middle of the deep end
I'm still standing on the shore line
And nobody hears me scream
And I'll lure you like a landslide
And I'll show you lovely things
If you rescue me but they'll make believe
The lighthouse by the sea

I met a sailor on a ship with promise in his eyes
He kissed me on the mouth and dug his fingers in my thighs
But a sailor ain't a savior 'cause they only tell you lies
So I left him there till the sunrise

Well, the waves were tall and they were crashing down
He's laying in the water begging God to let him drown
So I showed him all my teeth and then I laughed out loud
'Cause I never wanted saving, I just wanted to be found

There is a lighthouse in the
Middle of the deep end
I'm still stranded on the shore line
And nobody hears me scream
And I'll lure you like a landslide
And I'll show you lovely things
If you rescue me but they'll make believe
The lighthouse by the sea

Well, that should teach a man to mess with me
He was never seen again
And I'm still wandering the beach
And I'm glad I met the devil
'Cause he showed me I was weak
And a little piece of him is in a little piece of me

There is a lighthouse in the
Middle of the deep end
I'm still standing on the shore line
And nobody hears me scream
And I'll lure you like a landslide
And I'll show you lovely things
If you rescue me but they'll make believe
The lighthouse by the sea

And the waves come crashing down
And the waves come crashing down
And the waves come crashing down (And the waves come crashing down)
And the waves come crashing down (And the waves come crashing down)
And the waves come crashing down (And the waves come crashing down)
And the waves come crashing down (And the waves come crashing down)
And the waves come crashing down (And the waves come crashing down)
And the waves come crashing down (And the waves come crashing down)
