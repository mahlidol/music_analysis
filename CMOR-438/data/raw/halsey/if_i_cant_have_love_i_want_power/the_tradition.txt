Oh, the loneliest girl in town is bought for pennies a price
We dress her up in lovely gowns, she's easy on the eyes
Her soul is black and it's a fact that her sneer will eat you alive
And the buyer always brings her back, because all she does is cry

So take what you want
Take what you can
Take what you please
Don't give a damn
Ask for forgiveness
Never permission

Take what you want
Take what you can
Take what you please
Don't give a damn
It's in the blood and
This is tradition

Oh, the loneliest girl in town was bought for plenty a price
Well they dress her up in golden crowns, his smile hides a lie
She's smiles back, but it's a fact that her fear will eat her alive
Well she got the life that she wanted, but now all she does is cry

Take what you want
Take what you can
Take what you please
Don't give a damn
Ask for forgiveness
Never permission

Take what you want
Take what you can
Take what you please
Don't give a damn
It's in the blood and
This is tradition

You can't take it back
It's good as gone
Flesh Amnesiac
This is your song

And I hope what's left will last all summer long
And they said that, "Boys were boys", but they were wrong

Take what you want
Take what you can
Take what you please
Don't give a damn
Ask for forgiveness
Never permission

Take what you want
Take what you can
Take what you please
Don't give a damn
It's in the blood and
This is tradition

Take what you want
Take what you can
Take what you please
Don't give a damn
Ask for forgiveness
Never permission

Take what you want
Take what you can
Take what you please
Don't give a damn
It's in the blood and
This is tradition
