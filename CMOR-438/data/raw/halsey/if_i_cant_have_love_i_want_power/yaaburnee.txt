I get
Undertones of sadness when I think about the moments that I never got to spend with you
I can't decide
If I love you more in morning or I love you more in night
With its luminous lux tides, maybe in the daylight
All its pretty madness and the complicated status 'cause the moon don't pick sides
And the sun won't resign until you're by my side
Because the longing leads to leaving
And the loving leads to bleeding and your beauty is a blessing
And I never got to tell you how
I love the way my eyes make yours look green too

I think we could live forever
In each others faces 'cause I'll always see my youth in you
And if we don't live forever
Maybe one day we'll trade places
Darling, you will bury me before I bury you
Before I bury you

I'll never know
If there's danger in confession or it's memory that presses like a blade against my throat
Another word and I could choke
But what's worse?
Telling you my feelings or to die without revealing
That you crawled inside my head and set a fire there, instead
Letting all my insecurity
Devour me with certainty
That love is just a currency, so take my pockets
Take me whole
Take my life and take my soul, wrap me in a wedding ring
You know I swear I'd give you anything

And I think we could live forever
In each other's faces 'cause I'll always see my youth in you
And if we don't live forever
Maybe one day we'll trade places
Darling, you will bury me before I bury you
Before I bury you
