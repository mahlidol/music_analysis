Your eyes, so crisp, so green
Sour apple baby, but you taste so sweet
You got hips like Jagger and two left feet
And I wonder if you'd like to meet

Your voice is velvet through a telephone
You can come to mine, but both my roommates are home
Think I know a bar where they would leave us alone
And I wonder if you'd take it slow

Oh, we're dancing in my living room
And up come my fists
And I say, "I'm only playing," but
The truth is this
That I've never seen a mouth that I would kill to kiss
And I'm terrified, but I can't resist

And I said
Beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms and I know
That beautiful strangers only come along to do me wrong
And I hope, beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms
But I think it's finally, finally, finally, finally, finally safe
For me to fall
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

I grab your hand and then we run to the car
Singing in the street and playing air guitar
Stuck between my teeth just like a candy bar
And I wonder if it goes too far to say
I've never recognized a purer face
You stopped me in my tracks and put me right in my place
Used to think that loving meant a painful chase
But you're right here now and I think you'll stay

Oh, we're dancing in my living room
And up come my fists
And I say, "I'm only playing," but
The truth is this
I've never seen a mouth that I would kill to kiss
And I'm terrified, but the truth is this

I said
Beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms and I know
That beautiful strangers only come along to do me wrong and I hope
Beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms
And I think it's finally, finally, finally, finally, finally safe
For me to fall
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Yeah, I think it's finally, finally, finally, finally
