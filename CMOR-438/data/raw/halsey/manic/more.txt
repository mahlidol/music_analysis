They told me once nothing grows
When a house ain't a home
Is it true, honestly
When it's all a part of me?
A couple years of waiting rooms
Finding God and lose him too
Wanna scream but what's the use?

Lying awake and I stare at the door
I just can't take it no more
They told me it's useless
There's no hope in store
But somehow I just want you more

I want you more
Somehow I just want you more
I want you more
Somehow I just want you more

Wooden floors and little feet
A flower bud in concrete
Feeling so incomplete
Wonder will we ever meet?
And would you know it right away
How hard I tried to see your face?
A little screen, a photograph
Mine to take

I sit and I stare at your clothes in the drawer
I cry and my knuckles get sore
'Cause I still believe it won't be like before
Now somehow I just want you more

I want you more
Somehow I just want you more
I want you more
Somehow I just want you more

And when you decide it's your time to arrive
I've loved you for all of my life
And nothing could stop me from giving a try
I've loved you for all of my life

Love you more
Somehow I'll still love you more
Love you more
Somehow I'll still love you more

(Love you more)
(Somehow I'll still love you more)
(Love you more)
(Somehow I'll still love you more)
