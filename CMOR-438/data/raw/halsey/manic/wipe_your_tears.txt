You know I tell her all the time
Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby
Nothing's gonna make you cry
I'll be damned if I ever let another hand
Wipe your tears before they dry
Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby
Nothing's gonna make you cry
I'll be damned if I ever let another hand
Wipe your tears before they dry

Keep your friends close but this pretty girl closer
Kiss her on the neck, cradle baby is a poser
But she's so cold but the world is colder
Take her in my lap and I promise that I'll hold her

My bed is too big for only me
I keep a pistol when I sleep
Inside my mouth so I can shoot
Out all the bad things

You know I tell her all the time
Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby
Nothing's gonna make you cry
I'll be damned if I ever let another hand
Wipe your tears before they dry
(You know I tell her all the time)
Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby
Nothing's gonna make you cry
I'll be damned if I ever let another hand
Wipe your tears before they dry
