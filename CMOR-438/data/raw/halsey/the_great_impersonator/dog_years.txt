They said I have a universal blood type
I can give to anyone in need
But only receive from someone exactly like me

And I'm trying to B positive, but O it's really hard
I'm a loner, I'm a loser
Won't you shoot me in the yard?
Put me down like a lame horse
Or send me to the farm where all the dogs go

I've been a really good dog
Can I come inside?
Yeah, I've been such a good girl
Can we go for a ride?
I'm on a real short leash, but I like it tight
You know I'm such a sweet girl, but I can really bite
Really bite

'Cause my dog died last year, he fell asleep in my embrace
And the very last thing I told him was "See you soon and we can race"
You know a mercy-kill is what I seek
I didn't ask to live, but dying's up to me

I've been a really good dog
Can I come inside?
Yeah, I've been such a good girl
Can we go for a ride?
I'm on a real short leash, but I like it tight
You know I'm such a sweet girl, but I can really bite

Well, they say all dogs go to heaven
Well, what about a bitch?
What about an evil girl left lying in a ditch?
Tell the three people who ask that I am in a better place
With lots of trees and lots of grass
And lots of lots of chocolate cake

'Cause I'm not old but I am tired
I'm not strong, I'm very weak
I'm not old but I am tired
I'm not here, I'm somewhere else
I'm not old but I am tired
I'm one hundred ninety-six in dog years
I have seen enough
I've seen it all

I've been a really good dog
Can I come inside?
Yeah, I've been such a good girl
Can we go for a ride?
I'm on a real short leash, but I like it tight
You know I'm such a sweet girl, but I can really bite

Put me down like a lame horse
Or send me to the farm where all the dogs go
