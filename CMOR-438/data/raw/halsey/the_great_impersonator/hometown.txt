Davey died in the summertime in a hot-boxed car
With a seatbelt 'round his neck and a needle in his arm
We would smoke out in the parking lot behind convenience shops
I bought a couple of grams of weed off him, but so did all the cops
Back then

The kids from all the county, we would walk out in the heat
Along the train tracks with our paper bags and gravel in our feet
In our heads, we picked a husband from the hundred men we knew
But I kissed a poster of a pop star and checked my breasts in case they grew

There ain't a reason on this earth I'd go back to my hometown
Somewhere in the clouds, Davey's running for a touchdown
The crowd appears and his mother cheers, she's waving from the field
And he's evergreen at seventeen for the last eleven years

You know, I never felt like anyone, I was a paradox, ol' lie
I didn't think that I was special, but I was too afraid to die
Like the others from my high school, all those sad suburban ghosts
Trapped in a cross next to a highway while the rest of us get old

There ain't a reason on this earth I'd go back to my hometown
Somewhere in the clouds, Davey's running for a touchdown
The crowd appears and his mother cheers, she's waving from the field
And he's evergreen at seventeen for the last eleven years

The American dream means staying young forever
In a picture in a pamphlet, getting yellow from the weather
And years will pass since science class, and I might forget your name
But when the crow's feet come, to kingdom come, you'll always look the same

There ain't a reason on this earth I'd go back to my hometown
Somewhere in the clouds, Davey's running for a touchdown
The crowd appears and his mother cheers, and he's waving from the field
He's evergreen at seventeen for the last eleven years
