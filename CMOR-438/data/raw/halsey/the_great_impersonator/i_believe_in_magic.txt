My son is almost three
He used to look just like his dad, but right now he looks just like me
And as far as I can see
The fruit I bear is sweet
But the apple's rolling real far from the tree
And falling down the hill so full of love and so carefree
I wonder if the world will treat him any better than it treated me
Well Papa, don't you preach
I try to teach him every day that nothing good is free, but oh, it should be

And with all my roots above
And all my branches down below
Please tell my boy I love him so
Please tell the world I have to grow before I go
Well, I just wanted you to know

That I believe in magic and I believe in sin
I still believe in Heaven if they'll never let me in
I started to believe in love the day I met my little twin
I think I might start trying
Because I haven't been

My mama's getting old
Well, it's contagious and you catch it like a cold
She won't admit it, but it's something that I know
'Cause every year that passes for me passes her a hundredfold

Back in the day
My dad and I would share a laugh at all of her mistakes
But that alliance didn't save me from her fate
No, I didn't last till twenty-eight
Became a single mom, just crushed under the weight
Of a child growing faster than I think that I can take
I love him anyway
And I remind myself a time will come when he sees me turn grey
And realizes too late
Like I did with my mother
So now I tell her to her face

With all my roots above
And all my branches down below
Please tell my mom I love her so
Please tell the world I have to grow before I go
Well, I just wanted you to know

That I believe in magic and I still believe in sin
I still believe in Heaven if they'll never let me in
I started to believe in love the day I met my little twin
And I might start trying
Because I haven't been

I haven't been
But I love him so
