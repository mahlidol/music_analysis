I don't wanna go to grandma's
So I'm quiet on the drive

I don't wanna go to grandma's
So I'm quiet on the drive
I saw a deer that must've gotten hit
It made me start to cry
Did he have a mom and dad
And do they argue just like mine?
Did he have a little brother that annoyed him all the time?
Did he wanna be a grown-up?

Did he wanna be a grown-up?
Were there trees he liked to climb?
There was a boy I went to school with who had leukemia at five
Now his parents give him everything
They never yell or fight
Never make him cut his hair
'Cause they're happy he survived
He didn't have to clean his room
It was enough to be alive
When I was little, I was jealous
And I'd say a prayer at night
Well, I'd say

"Please, God, I wanna be sick
But I don't wanna hurt so get it over with quick
Please, God, I wanna be loved
I don't wanna be somebody that they wanna get rid of
Please, God, I wanna be sick
I don't wanna hurt so get it over with quick
Please, God, I wanna be loved
I don't wanna be somebody they wanna get rid of"
