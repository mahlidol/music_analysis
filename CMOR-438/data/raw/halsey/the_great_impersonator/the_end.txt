Every couple of years now
The doctor says I'm sick
Pulls out a brand-new bag of tricks
And then they lay it on me
Well, at first, it was my brain
Then a skeleton in pain
And I don't like to complain
But I'm saying, "Sorry"

When I met you, I thought I was damaged goods
Had a fucked up childhood
And there's poison in my brain and in my blood

If you knew it was the end of the world
Could you love me like a child?
Could you hold me in the dark?
If we knew it was the end of the world
Would you like to stay a while?
Would you leave when it gets hard?

So, I ran into the clinic
And I asked to see the man
With his white coat and his stethoscope
Like a snake around his hand
And I told him I'm not bitter
'Cause I finally found a lover
Who is better for my liver
And now I'll finally recover

When I met him, I thought I was damaged goods
From a real bad neighborhood
So we wrestled in the mud
And I told him he could stay right where he stood
But I don't know if he should
'Cause once my god destroys the flesh, then there's the flood

If you knew it was the end of the world
Could you love me like a child?
Could you hold me in the dark?
If we knew it was the end of the world
Would you like to stay a while?
Maybe we could build an ark

We could sail on broken driftwood
Through the sopping wet terrain
And count the buildings and the bodies
Getting swallowed by the rain
And in the water, there's the doctor
Who didn't listen to my claim
Oh, what a shame
He's circling the drain

When I met you, I said I would never die
But the joke was always mine
'Cause I'm racing against time
And I know it's not the end of the world
But could you pick me up at 8:00?
'Cause my treatment starts today
