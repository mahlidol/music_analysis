No one has to know
I could always hide
But sometimes it might get to me
The things on all their minds
Like they don't know I'm lonely
And they don't know I'm kind
Or scared that I can't hack it with the current paradigm

Every single line
Every single rhyme
Every single truth I sing once started as a lie
I promise that I'm fine
But then I redesign
And put myself together like some little Frankenstein

Ah-ah!
Does a story die with its narrator?
Ah-ah!
Surely it's forgotten sooner, later
Ah-ah!
Hope they spell my name right in the paper
Ah-ah!
In here lies the great impersonator

I'm lying in a car crash
In a pile of broken glass
It's funny how it looks like glitter from the overpass
I'm in a pickup truck
The door is stuck
I'm sinking in the water
And the girl inside is waving
But the people just applaud her
This is a cry for help
Calling for assistance
But you can't tell I need it, when you're watching from a distance

Ah-ah!
Does a story die with its narrator?
Ah-ah!
Surely it's forgotten sooner, later
Ah-ah!
Hope they spell my name right in the paper
Ah-ah!
In here lies the great impersonator
