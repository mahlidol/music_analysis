She spent twenty years in the Dakota
Every single day was black in the Dakota
Riot grrrls think you can stop
And you're forever in her debt
Well, I know you haven't sank me
And you haven't sank her yet

She spent twenty years like a virus
They want to burn the witches inside us
Well, you, you don't fuck with the Fabulous Four
Or you spend the rest of your life
Picking things up off the floor

She's still alive, but I am sure
That all the stars belong to her
Oh, California king-sized bed
She's wrapped in rags inside my head

This is the story, this is the story of someone's wife
Big black rules her whole life
(I don't remember, I forget)

Oh baby, dry your dirty eyes
My water breaks like turpentine
The pee girl burns to be a bride
Your ever-lovely suicide
Hey, ah
Hey, ah

Are they coming for me?
Are they coming soon?
Hey Jude, hey Jude
Are they coming for me?
Judy, Judy, are they coming soon?
(I don't remember, I forget)
The pee girl burns to be a bride
Your ever-lovely suicide
(I haven't left there yet
I don't remember, I forget)

I don't remember, I forget
