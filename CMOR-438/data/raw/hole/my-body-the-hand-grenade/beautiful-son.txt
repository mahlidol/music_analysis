You look good in my dress
Now get your friends to clean the mess
You look good in my clothes
I can feel where the doctor goes

My beautiful son
My beautiful son
My beautiful son
My beautiful son

Yeah, I know
Yeah! I know

He had ribbons in his hair
And lipstick was everywhere
You look good in my dress
You look good in my dress

My beautiful son
My beautiful son
My beautiful son
My beautiful son
Yeah, I know, I know

You're barren
Like me
You're barren
Yeah, I know
Yeah, I know

My beautiful son
My beautiful son
My beautiful son
My beautiful son
