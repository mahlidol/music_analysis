Now you complain, you say want the keys
Over my dead body, baby, that's where they'll be
Forget-me-nots around your neck
You say you remember, baby, you forget

Hey hey, this much is true
I never trusted you
Hey hey, this much is true
Now I burn black for you

And I'm trying just to forget
Never, I won't
Never, I won't
Never, ever
Never!

Saying the things that you can't hear
My dumb mouth to your deaf ear
Gushing lump, a violent smear
My dumb mouth to your deaf ear

Hey hey, this much is true
I never twisted you
Hey hey, this much is true
Baby, I burn black for you

No, I won't go down to this
Never, I won't
Ever, I won't
Never, I won't
Never!

Crawl
Right up the wall
And up the stairs
And down your hall, wow!

Now you beg, and you want me
Over my dead body, baby, that's where I'll be
And you laugh at my disease
While sugar runs from my arteries

Hey hey, this much is true
I never bothered you
Hey hey, this much is true
Baby, I'd burn black for you

And I'm trying just to forget
Never, I won't
Never, I won't
Never, I won't
Never!

Starts out like magic, some sick religion
That ain't no vulture, that's a fucking pigeon
She's got vultures in her hair
And blood and feathers, they are everywhere
You want retreat, filthy, deep
A dead moon, a drunken seed
Baby girl, there is a room
Full of death and whores and truth
And I am waiting in that room
And I am dying, yeah, for you
It's all whores! It's all pain!
It's all disease, man! It's all the same!
My little Judas, my little twin
Where you start, that's where I'll begin, she said

"I want it now," she said, "I want it now," she said
"I want it now," she said, "I want it now," she said
"I want it now," she said, "I want it now," she said
"I want it now," she said, "I want it now, now!"
