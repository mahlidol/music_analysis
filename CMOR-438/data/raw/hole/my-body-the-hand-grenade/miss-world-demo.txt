I am the one you know, I lie, lie and lie
No matter where you go, I try, try and try
I am the girl you know who lies and lies and lies
I am the girl you know, I lie and lie and lie

I'm Miss World
Somebody kill me
Kill me, pills
No one cares, my friends

I'm Miss World
Watch me break
And watch me burn
No one can hear me, my friends

Kill girls watch
I eat ether
Suck me under
Maybe forever, my friends

My friends
My friends
My friends
My friend

I am the girl you know who lies and lies and lies
No matter where you are, I lie and want to whine
No one can hear you now, cries and cries and cries
I am the girl you know who lies and lies and lies
