You just don't love me and I just don't care
Oh, I never said I would play fair
Something so perfect and so rare
There is no cure, there's not a prayer, a prayer
Look what I can do

I am the only perfect choice
You've met your match, I've lost my voice
And when you're gone it gets so cold
I swear I'm too young to be this old, this old
Look what I can do

Oh, I've been cheated
Covered in diamonds and covered in filth
But I'm still breathing
Oh, please stick around and I'll build

Yes, I've crawled on glass to grasp at straws
Stuttering, staggering through
And I've pierced the last hole in my arm
To gouge out the pieces of you

And your staggering, stuttering greed
And your never-ending need
And your terrible, awful deeds
And your lack of truth in these things

You know the whole thing is rigged
You'll always quit, you always did
To the most delusional stare
And all that I have is out and laid bare, and laid bare
Look what I can do
What I can do
Look what I can do

Oh, I've been bittered
You know what's true and you know what's right
Oh, I'm forever
Oh, just do the right thing for once in your life, in your life

I know that I'm a hungry lost girl
But please stick around and I'll build you a world
I'll build you a world
I'll build you a world
