Anguish and misery
Fall here like a dead star
And everything you ever said
Now tears me all apart

He goes down, down to his bitter end
He knows now, now it's the gutter
He goes down, down to his bitter end
He knows now, now you can't touch him

Pray for the rain
Are you up there, do you listen?
It's the terror and the pain
And I just wait 'til you have risen

He goes down, down to his only friend
He knows now, now that you love him
He goes down, down to his bitter end
He knows now, now you can't touch him

Hold onto you
Like the death of an angel
And I hold onto you
With all the life that's in me

Why wasn't I good enough
To save you from destruction?
And your end and my beginning
Oh, they need no introduction

He goes down, down to his only friend
He knows now, now that you love him
He goes down, down to his bitter end
He knows now, now you can't touch him

Sweet as honey
I'll live forever
Pure as first love
Just come home

Hold on to you
Like the death of an angel
And I hold on to you
With all the life that's in me
And I hold on to you
Like the death of an angel
And I hold on to you
With all the hope I have left

And I hold on to you
Watch the death of an angel
And I hold on to you
Until the light pours like honey
