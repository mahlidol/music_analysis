I've lost my mind, yeah
I've lost control
I've lost the feeling in my arms
I'm a lost soul

Make the most of me, baby
Oh, don't spit me out
This is how dirty girls get clean
Don't leave me now

Listen to her lust, yeah
Hear her disgrace
Listen to the fragile things
As they all break

Watch from the covers
The comfort of your home
Through the ice and sleet, baby
Oh, down, down we go

What angry star runs your devil heart?
What angry star runs your devil heart?

Oh, oh, how'd you get so mean?
This is the only way d-dirty girls stay clean

And I wanted you
Like no one before
Said, "You're coming back for me, honey."
This is how Hell forms

This is how a storm begins
This is how trouble's born
Listen to her sleep, yeah
Listen to her wail

You've given birth to terrible things
Watch them unveil
Listen to my torment
Listen to my pain
Please come on back here, baby
Let me try again

What angry star
Runs your devil heart?
What angry star
Runs your devil heart?

Oh, oh, how'd you get so mean?
This is the only way d-dirty girls stay clean

And the rain, it poured down
And the wind, it moaned
And she wrapped her legs around him
And she's got no home

And he's looking at me
Oh god he looks so dumb
What are you staring at?
This is how it's done

I will define for you
The meaning of greed
While you were vanishing
This dirty girl got clean

What angry star runs your devil heart?
What angry star runs your devil heart?

Oh, oh, how'd you get so mean?
This is the only way d-dirty girls stay clean
Oh, oh, how'd you get so mean?
This is the only way d-dirty girls stay clean
Oh, oh, how'd you get so mean?
This is the only way d-dirty girls stay clean
