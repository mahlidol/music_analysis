Dear God
I'm writing this letter to You
'Cause I don't have a clue
Can You help me?

I'm sitting here
Simply trying to figure out
What my life's all about
Can You tell me?

I never wanted to be
The person You see
Can You tell me who I am?
I always wanted to die
But You kept me here alive
Can You tell me who I am?

I lie awake
Conducting this symphony
That You have gifted to me
But I can't ever sleep

Don't be mad
But I get weak inside
And I start to fall apart
'Cause I feel nothing

I never wanted to be
Some kind of comic relief
Please show me who I am
I've been tortured and scorned
Since the day that I was born
But I don't know who I am

And I thank You, man, for everything
I'm sorry I'm so frightened about all of it
But I wish I could give You more
And all the lights are shining down on me
And I feel intimidated by it all

I never wanted to be
The person You see
But thank You
Oh, God, please tell me now
Are You disappointed? Are You proud?
Haven't I done everything? Everything?
I'm so sorry I'm so weak
And I've turned into a freak
But I don't know anything, anything
I've lost all self-esteem
By burying everything
And I feel nothing, nothing
Oh, God, please tell me now
Oh, God, please tell me now
'Cause I feel nothing
And dear God
I'm writing this letter to You
I am coming unglued
Please help me
