You were beautiful, you were glorious
Now you're, you're covered in loser dust
You were fabulous, you were gorgeous
Now you're, you're covered in loser dust
And all the things I used to trust, yeah
All the things I'm about to crush
Your youth is gone, it's turned to rust
It's all covered in loser dust

Hey, I loathe every inch of you
You're going down for what you love
Hey, every single particle
You're going down for your loser dust
Hey, all the things you used to trust
You're going down

I'm burnt out, I'm furious
And look at you, you're embarrassing us
Ascend, descend and go, you must
Isolate the prize, give it one big flush
It's indiscreet, omnivorous
We won't call you and don't call us
And all that's sick with gloat and lust and
And don't call me, this time I'm serious

It's not an image, it's just a way
You're going down for your final crush
Hey, nothing here can stop you with
You're going down for your loser dust
Hey, I can't wait to see you go
You're going down for your loser dust
Hey, show me one thing I didn't know
You're going down

Faded fast baby, what is the rush?
The very thing you would never trust!
The very thing you would never touch!
It's all covered in loser dust!

These women all around, obsessive cunts
File under miscellaneous
They're starving and carnivorous
I, I mustn't touch what I want so much
You, you make me nervous, you make me drunk
Do you have to grovel so very much?
It's so unfair, it's so unjust
It's just another witch hunt!

Broke down, shattered, busted, yeah
You're going down for what you love
Hey, all the death, it's just good, yeah
You're going down for your loser dust
Hey, oh, just die in public, babe
Going down for your loser dust
Hey, in you lies a gutter, yeah
You're going down for your loser dust

Hey, we can't wait to see you go
You're going down, hey!
