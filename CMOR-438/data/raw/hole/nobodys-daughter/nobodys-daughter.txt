Made something better, he kept it for himself
I'm not that stupid, I just need a lot of help
To understand how stupid you really are

Down at the bottom of the ocean, I lay down
Nobody's coming, just continue to drown
And no one here could ever stop my ruin now, now

And I know I've got not to fear
You'll get me out
Oh God, just get me out of here
Are you astounding us, surrounding us?

And asphyxiate all your pain away
Don't try to win, it will only end in disgrace

Nobody's daughter, she never was, she never will
Be beholden to anyone she cannot kill
You don't understand how damaged we really are
You don't understand how evil we really are

And I will dig my own grave, yeah
I'm misbegotten
I am the last one you save here
Of course I'll sleep forever and forever

Anesthetize all your horrors away
We live inside this black web that you have spun
Greed, your bile is miles away
Don't tell me I have I lost when clearly I've won

I want to see you stretched out on the floor
The world-broken doll, the world's shattered whore
And you, you can't walk, but you, you crawl
Come on, infect us all

Asphyxiate all your pain away
Don't try to win, it will only end in disgrace
Translucent eyes in the cold light of day
It's glorious, it's terrible, God I need it
It's beautiful, it's ravenous, I'll just feed it
Coil down to your dark black decay

And I will dig my own grave now
I'm misbegotten
I am the last one you save here
It's all gone rotten
