Skinny little bitch
Staring at the mirror
In your desperation
'Til you disappear

And you would be oh-so-dumb
To fuck with me
'Cause, baby, you're much too young
To end up with me

Your bedroom wall's fallen down
And everyone can see you now
Your bedroom walls, they sell for cheap
You lie, you lie alone, you lie alone, you never sleep
Ah, you never sleep

Ow! Skinny little bitch
Praying to the Lord
Praying for some salvation
'Cause she's oh-so-bored

In my vile sex horror
And my cheap drugs hell
And all the things you'll never
Live to tell

And you will never see the light
I'll just obscure it out of spite
Just a nasty piece of work
Come on, come on, baby, come on, baby, let it burn
Oh, baby, does it hurt?

Born of foul creation
Born of sour milk, cocaine filth

You staggered here on broken glass
So I could kick your scrawny ass
All the drugs and all the burns
What a nasty, what a nasty, nasty piece of work
Oh, baby, does it hurt?
Oh, baby, just go slower
Oh, baby, just go lower

Skinny little bitch
Skinny little bitch
Skinny little bitch
Skinny little bitch
Skinny little bitch
Skinny little bitch
Skinny little bitch
Skinny little bitch
Skinny little bitch
Skinny little bitch
