She tears the hole up even wider
Lets all the darkness up inside her
Holy old, yeah, hey, you're mine
Your everything is mine

Without, without a doubt
Without, without a doubt

Hey, where the fuck were you when my lights went out?
Yeah, you don't want to look at it now
Yeah, you don't want to look at it
Wow!

Without, without a doubt
Come on and let me out

Hey, where the fuck were you when my lights went out?
Yeah, you don't want to look at it now
Yeah, you don't want to look at me

Come on and let me out
Come on and let me out

Yeah, tie a soul to you when your life goes down
Time flies when you're falling down
I spread my rot all over this town
And every one of you looks the same
And every one of you feels the same
