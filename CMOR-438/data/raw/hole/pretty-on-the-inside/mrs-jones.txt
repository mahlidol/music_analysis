Sorry, man, sorry, sorry
I've got a bad eye
I shouldn't have— I should've looked at it
I, I should've looked at it
Go, go away, go away
The sugar star, the sugar star
And the, the abortionist, hey, hey
You want her on the bed
With her legs wide open and her eyes all spread

Sky's a narcotic with blackjack bones, oh
Mrs. Jones, oh, Mrs. Jones, oh
Cry me a river, but just take me home, oh
Mrs. Jones, oh, Mrs. Jones

Sorry, man, I've gotta—
I've got it slimming
Fucking ran away with my abortionist
My little eye blacked with all the jizz
And the knife they used to gut my face in
It's been out stabbing baby, baby angels, and
Smile, smile

The sky's a narcotic with blackjack bones, oh
Mrs. Jones, please, Mrs. Jones
My virus is raging, it's breaking my bones, oh
Mrs. Jones, please, Mrs. Jones

Cry, survive
Well, I will follow you down the sick drain
When I lean on, on the sink
Don't worry, don't worry
Don't worry, baby
You will, you will never stink so bad
Whoa!

Sorry, man, I'm sorry
I shouldn't have looked at it, I
I'm sorry, man
You're a night blooming sickle cell
You're a night blooming sickle cell
I ran away, I ran away
Look into the bloodroot, you suicide bitch
It takes an hour like you to make me wanna live
I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry, man
I'm sorry, man, whoa!

The sky's a narcotic with blackjack bones, oh
Mrs. Jones, oh, Mrs. Jones
Cute little doggie won't leave me alone, oh
Mrs. Jones, please, Mrs. Jones
My virus is raging, it's breaking my bones, oh
Mrs. Jones, please, Mrs. Jones, oh
Cry me a river, baby, just take me home, oh
Mrs. Jones, oh, Mrs. Jones

Sister Ectoplasma, she's incredulous
Just like a pro, she takes off her dress
And she kicks you down in her snow-white pumps
Just remember, it was me who found the lump
Shit! Shit!

Shit! Shit!
East is east, and west is west
And mine was you, and mine was the best, yeah
East is east, and west is west
And mine was you, and mine was, mine was all
Mrs. Jones

Don't ask me again
Don't ever talk to me like that again
