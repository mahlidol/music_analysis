"You do not"

"You do not"

It's the thing in your thighs when you're lonely at night
Scroll though your phone getting high off the light
Numb in your chest when you close the blinds
Repose in time
And you tell yourself you're fine
But you

Sabotage the things you love the most
Camouflage so you can feed the lie that you're composed

This is the voice in your head that says
"You do not want this"
This is the ache that says
"You do not want him"
This is the glimmer of light that you're keeping alive when you tell yourself
"Bet I could fuck him"

Why do you need love so badly?
Bet it's because of her daddy
Bet she was brutal and bratty
Bet that she'll never be happy
I bet that you're right
And I'll show you in time
But I

Sabotage the things I love the most
Camouflage so I can feed the lie that I'm composed

I've got a monster inside me
That eats personality types
She is constantly changing her mind on the daily
Think that she hates me
I'm feeling it lately
Might have to trick her and treat her
To 70 capsules or fly to a castle
So at least we could say that we died being traveled
Cultured and flattered
And then I could trap her
But what does it matter

"You do not want this"
This is the voice in her head that says
"You do not want him"
This is that space in your bed that says
"Bet I could fuck him"
Isn't it lonely?
These are the standards
To which you could hold me
Think that you know me
You think that you could if you hold me
Think you could try to console me
But I do not know me
No I do not know me
'Cause I
'Cause I

Sabotage the things I love the most
Camouflage so I can feed the lie that I'm composed
"You do not want this"
Sabotage the things I love the most
"You do not want this"
Camouflage so I can feed the lie that I'm composed
"You do not want this"
"You do not want this"
"You do not"
