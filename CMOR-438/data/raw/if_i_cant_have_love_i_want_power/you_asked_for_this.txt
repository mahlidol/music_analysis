I don't know what you want from me
When I'm sunburnt lips and summer feet
I'm tattered like these Levi jeans
Punch-wasted on redundancy

Now what the fuck does all this mean
You know I'm still somebody's daughter, see
I spilled the milk you left for me
My tears are falling flawlessly now

Go on and be a big girl
You asked for this now
Go on and be a big girl
Everybody's gonna drown you out
Go on and be a big girl
You asked for this now
You better show 'em why you talk so loud

You wished upon a falling star
And then left behind the avant garde
For lemonade in crystal glasses
Picket fences, file taxes
Who the hell is in your bed?
You better kiss goodnight and give some head
And then next then morning comes instead
Well is this the life that lies ahead now?

Go on and be a big girl
You asked for this now
Go on and be a big girl
Everybody's gonna drown you out
Go on and be a big girl
You asked for this now
You better show 'em why you talk so loud

Go on and be a big girl
You asked for this now
Go on and be a big girl
Everybody's gonna drown you out
Go on and be a big girl
You asked for this now
You better show 'em why you talk so loud

I want my cake on a silver platter
I want a fistful in my hands
I want a beautiful boy's despondent laughter
I want to ruin all my plans
I want a fist around my throat
I want to cry so hard I choke
I want everything I asked for
