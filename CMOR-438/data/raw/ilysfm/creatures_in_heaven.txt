Three in the morning, making love
Laid on the floor of your apartment
Bird's eye view of the two of us
Face in make-up and cheap fake blood
What do you think about when you think about love?
I'm dumbstruck when you're tender, but
It's three in the morning, be in the moment
Here in a moment, free in a moment

It tears through my head, does it haunt you too?
Diamonds in the dark in your old bedroom
You held me like my mother made me just for you
You held me so close that I broke in two
It tears through my head, does it haunt you too?
Never really said that I loved you, too
Lucky, lucky you, 'cause I'm fortune's fool
Such small words but they hit so huge

I don't think I realize
Just how much I miss you sometimes
We were young and so in love
We were just creatures in heaven
I don't think I realize
Just how much I miss you sometimes
For a moment, we were just
We were just creatures in heaven

Three in the morning, safe inside
Bury me here in your laundry pile, at
Three in the morning, be in the moment
Here in the moment, free in the moment
Three in the morning, over like that
Go slow-motion, cut it to black
'Cause it's merely a moment, here for a moment
Here is the moment, here for a moment

It tears through my head, does it haunt you too?
Diamonds in the dark in your old bedroom
You held me like my mother made me just for you
You held me so close that I broke in two
It tears through my head, does it haunt you too?
Never really said that I loved you, too
Lucky, lucky you, 'cause I'm fortune's fool
Such small words but they hit so huge

I don't think I realize
Just how much I miss you sometimes
We were young and so in love
We were just creatures in heaven
I don't think I realize
Just how much I miss you sometimes
For a moment, we were just
We were just creatures in heaven

I don't see the point in a subtle romance
Ten tonne heartache sitting on your back
Scared of the crack where the light comes through
I'm only really me when I'm here with you
And it gets into your head like a cosmic zoom
Coat on the door like an old space suit
So long cowboy, you're so cool
Cash in hand with a memory of you

I don't think I realize
Just how much I miss you sometimes
We were young and so in love
We were just creatures in heaven
I don't think I realize
Just how much I miss you sometimes
For a moment, we were just
We were just creatures in heaven

Creatures in heaven
Back then, we were just
Creatures in heaven
We were just creatures in heaven
