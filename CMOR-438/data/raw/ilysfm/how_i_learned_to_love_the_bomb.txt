I always thought it was
Only the two of us
But I saw another one
Split like a thunderstruck
Tree trunk or maybe the
Splits in your knuckles
The split lip you lick too much

Running around
And we're playing the blame game
Black Swan I'll
Never see you the same way
Which one is you
Oh is anything true?
Which one is you
Oh is anything true?
And what should I do
Just pretend it's the same, same?
Once you get bit
A little bit of the pain stays
Ache in the tooth
On a sweet afternoon
A fly in the room
You can't get with your shoe

And you're just two sided
So goddamn indecisive
Oh and it's deep in inside you
I think I just found the bomb
Baby, how do you hide it so?
How do you live like this?
When you get home, who'll I get?
I don't know when you'll explode

You switch it off
You switch it on
I'm sat there holding on for the bomb
You switch it off
You switch it on
I'm sat there holding on for the bomb

You say there's nothing wrong
I peel myself of the wall
Thought you brought butter cups
Whoa, that's a tommy gun
Meat hooks and diamond dust
Ghost Rider, here he comes

Running around
And we're playing the blame game
Black Swan I'll
Never see you the same way
Which one is you
Oh is anything true?
Which one is you
Oh is anything true?
And what should I do
Just pretend it's the same, same?
Once you get bit
A little bit of the pain stays
Ache in the tooth
On a sweet afternoon
A fly in the room
You can't get with your shoe

And you're just two sided
So goddamn indecisive
Oh and it's deep in inside you
I think I just found the bomb
Baby, how do you hide it so?
How do you live like this?
When you get home, who'll I get?
I don't know when you'll explode

Maybe it's just a strange time
That I found you in your life
Maybe I can learn to like
All that I find terrifying
Maybe this is how it is
Maybe this is most exciting
Maybe I'll find a safe distance
I know there's a bomb in this

And you're just two sided
So goddamn indecisive
Oh and it's deep in inside you
I think I just found the bomb
Baby, how do you hide it so?
How do you live like this?
When you get home, who'll I get?
I don't know when you'll explode

You switch it off
You switch it on
I'm sat there holding on for the bomb
You switch it off
You switch it on
I'm sat there holding on for the bomb
