I can't make you fall in love again
I can't give you back your innocence
Freedom at last, I know you wanted it
But freedom don't last when you've got no one left

That's just one more thing about you
I don't need in my life
Never gave me goodbye
But you were gone in high school
You walked out of my life
I still wonder sometimes
What would we have been like?
But you were gone in

That's just one more thing about you
I don't need in my life
Never gave me goodbye
But you were gone in high school
You walked out of my life
I still wonder sometimes
What would we have been like?
But you were gone in

I can't make you fall in love again
I can't take away your bitterness
I can't make you fall in love again
I can't give you back your tenderness

Sunday afternoons
Go Adamson's Lagoon
Your blurry old tattoos
My faded jelly shoes
A box of apple juice
I'm always late for school

It was never good enough
We were never good enough
It was never really you
So I can't make you fall in love again

That's just one more thing about you
I don't need in my life
Never gave me goodbye
But you were gone in high school
You walked out of my life
I still wonder sometimes
What would we have been like?
But you were gone in

That's just one more thing about you
I don't need in my life
Never gave me goodbye
But you were gone in high school
You walked out of my life
I still wonder sometimes
What would we have been like?
But you were gone in

The light that afternoon
Exposed the cracks in you
The ones you filled with dust
You're looking so much older
Shoulders folded over
Paint curled in the sun

Now Friday nights, alone
They see you in Flamingo's
For the early show
There's lipstick on your throat
You wore too much cologne
And then you stumble home
