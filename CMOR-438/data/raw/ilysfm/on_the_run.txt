I swear that I try, swear that I try
Just to get it all the right way
Somehow I find every time
That I shit the bed anyway
The internet said, internet said
It would take a firm commitment
Ooh, but I got a way, definitely
That I can make it painless
I'm thinking this, I'm thinking this
Thinking I should fake my own death

There's no fixing this
Thanks for all the fish
I'll go and you'll forget this
'Cause them's the consequences

Ooh
I'm going on the run, on the run, on the run, on the, on the run
Run, on the run, on the run, on the, on the run
Run, on the run, on the run, on the, on the run
Run, on the run, on the run, on the, on the run
Run, on the run, on the run, on the, on the run
Run, on the run, on the run, on the, on the run

Never look for trouble, but I keep steppin' in it
I wish I could keep my loafers clean for a minute
But the baggage keeps on comin' like your glitter in the kitchen
Or the sand inside my shoe that I can't quite get rid of
Now I'm burnin' rubber with the wind in my face
I got fake moustaches, keep 'em new every day
Thirty million hundred thousand light years away
But the sadness is behind me with his own wheelie case
Deep in Alabama and I cruise faster than
Faster than the memories of you if I can
Don't abort the mission, Dave, I made my decision
And you'll feel better if you think I sleep with the fishes

There's no fixing this
Thanks for all the fish
I'll go and you'll forget this
'Cause them's the consequences

Ooh, run, on the run, on the run, on the, on the run
Run, on the run, on the run, on the, on the run
Run, on the run, on the run, on the, on the run
Run, on the run, on the run, on the, on the run
Run, on the run, on the run, on the, on the run
Run, on the run, on the run, on the, on the run

For two moments, I feel so great
'Cause there's no more worries, no spinning plates
Somehow I feel more than ten feet
Taller instantaneously
It all seems smaller, so far away
And I miss that noise you make when you sleep
I turn back now, my scars and my stains
And I'm back before you know I escaped

There's no fixing this
Thanks for all the fish
I'll go and you'll forget this
'Cause them's the consequences

Ooh, I'm going on the run, on the run, on the run, on the, on the run
Run, on the run, on the run, on the, on the run
Run, on the run, on the run, on the, on the run
Run, on the run, on the run, on the, on the run
Run, on the run, on the run, on the, on the run
Run, on the run, on the run, on the, on the run
Run, on the run, on the run, on the, on the run
Run, on the run, on the run, on the, on the run
Run, on the run, on the run, on the, on the run
Run, on the run, on the run, on the, on the run
Run, on the run, on the run, on the, on the run
Run, on the run, on the run, on the, on the run
