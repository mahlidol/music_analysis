Show pony, make it burn
Smile as the knife is turned
Show pony making a return
As we make our way through the-

I'll begin at the beginning, you met in New York City
He was sitting like a prince on the stairs of his old building
And he kissed you, you were finished, two months in a minute
Married at a desk in your sundress with a witness
Had a honeymoon in Texas, went to Little Venice
Told him with your eyes, now you're crying in the clinic
And we pile into the Plymouth, haircuts in the kitchen
He always fell asleep just before the movie finished

But you don't, baby, you're alone
Echoes in your head, pressed into the floor
Two-dimensional
When's it gonna end? Maybe when you're dead?
Maybe you're a fool, but he loved you
And he loved you in a t-shirt, mmm
All the memories inside your curves
Now you're coming back to show us that, girl
So roll those credits, 'cause the sequel's gonna hurt, mmm

Show pony, make it burn
Smile as the knife is turned
Show pony making a return
As we make our way through the universe
Show pony making it burn
That's how revenge is served
Make it so cold that it hurts
I guess he's right that you live and learn

It's how the story goes, ramen on your own
Waiting by the phone, lipstick on the coat
Waiting by the door, you live in his clothes
You would make a joke that you had none of your own
All that shit I learned from you
Kindness spilt like milk and juice
So blindsided by the truth
In some way I was sure you knew

But you don't, baby, you're alone
Echoes in your head, pressed into the floor
Two-dimensional
When's it gonna end? Maybe when you're dead?
Maybe you're a fool, but he loved you
And he loved you in a t-shirt, mmm
All the memories inside your curves
Now you're coming back to show us that, girl
So roll those credits, 'cause the sequel's gonna hurt, mmm

Show pony, make it burn
Smile as the knife is turned
Show pony making a return
As we make our way through the universe

All those nights he left you and me
There was nothing left of you, but he squeezed
All those times he did what he pleased
Boy, those scars must really run deep
And all that hurt comes out in one scream
And it pierced him like the paper receipt
That you got that time you went for food
That first night that he saw you

Show pony, make it burn
Smile as the knife is turned
Show pony making a return
As we make our way through the universe
Show pony making it burn
That's how revenge is served
Make it so cold that it hurts
I guess he's right that you live and learn
