What the hell is happening? What is this?
I just got thrown in the trunk
Of a blacked-out 1999 Corolla, woah
If anyone can hear this, do something
Speedin' like a satellite
Hog tied and stuffed behind the taillights, woah
Come on

Hold fire, hold fire
I got second thoughts as I realise
I'm so alive, I'm so alive
I love this so much that I could cry

I'm so happy, this is just where I wanna be
I'm so happy, this is just where I wanna be
I'm so happy, this is just where I wanna be
I'm so happy, this is just where I wanna be

True love, what a fucking beautiful shit-storm
But it makes me wonder who's been driving us
Ohh, mm
One bump at speed and the trunk pops open
Just as I was getting comfortable
Man, are you serious? My luck, my luck
Locked eyes with the kid in the car behind us
Put a finger to my lips and I smiled
And I pull it shut
(That was a close one)

And if I survive, if I survive
I'll do this again every summertime
I'm so happy with my hands tied
Being kidnapped is my thing in life

I'm so happy, this is just where I wanna be
I'm so happy, this is just where I wanna be
I'm so happy, this is just where I wanna be
I'm so happy, this is just where I wanna be

Repo man, hey, how's it going?
Don't want to impose
All good back here, keep on rollin'
Just thought you should know
Somehow I feel safer here
Then I would do at home
Just tree-shaped air fresheners
And air from bullet holes

I'm so happy, this is just where I wanna be
I'm so happy, this is just where I wanna be
I'm so happy, this is just where I wanna be
I'm so happy, this is just where I wanna be

Such a night exciting hijacking
What a lovely little time we've had
Really took me by surpri—
