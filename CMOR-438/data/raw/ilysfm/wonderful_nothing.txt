Wonderful nothing
You just want something nice
You just want substance
I just wanna cut out both your eyes
Wonderful nothing
You just want something kind
I want corruption
I think I'm the devil in disguise
Here's my state of mind
Give me destruction
Tell me I'm scrumptious
I'm a fucking delight

I come back in with a one, two
Sucker punch in the gut, here's a tissue
Truth hurts when it points right at you
Sit down now for some ground rules, thank you
Don't talk, that's it, just one
Do you think you can handle that much?
I've just come back to life
I'm here, I'm your little ray of sunshine

Your party's so damn tired
Kinkiness pretty light and
You're dressed up like a tiger
But you're a fly stuck in my eye and

What's that face?
Oh, you got some scrapes but I'll pile drive you anyway
And I hoped and I prayed
I kept on thinking that it'd all change one day
Been a great gun fight
You drew blood, I set myself on fire
But you've had your time
Oh, you've had your time, mm

Who are you talkin' to? What your daddy do?
Oh, you poor boo-boo, he's a lizard too
Hit the mini-mart, buy the bitter truth
Get a few ball gags, they're on three for two
Buy a better mood, buy a point of view
Yours went off in June 1992
Get some attitude, get some nuance too
Get me solitude and a good excuse
When

I come back in with a one, two
Sucker punch in the gut, here's a tissue
Truth hurts when it points right at you
Sit down now for some ground rules, thank you
Don't talk, that's it, just one
Do you think you can handle that much?
I've just come back to life
I'm here, I'm your little ray of sunshine

Wonderful nothing
I just want something wrong
I want indulgence
I just wanna make it out alive
Wonderful nothing
I want you to bury me alive
Put me in a dungeon
I come back in with the one, two

I come back in with a one, two
Sucker punch in the gut, here's a tissue
Truth hurts when it points right at you
Sit down now for some ground rules, thank you
Don't talk, that's it, just one
Do you think you can handle that much?
I've just come back to life
I'm here, I'm your little ray of sunshine

You got big ideas, they're as shit as you
Tryna self-combust, just for an excuse
Say I might throw up just to leave the room
I'd say, "Burn in hell," but they'd hate you too
In my mind, I'm annotating you
What is that you're wearing? Oh, it's too much booze
Did your mum tell you close it when you chew?
Now scuttle home, go and lick your wounds
I'm a fly inside of your facial goop
I'm a little hair sat inside your soup
There's the rub, maybe I'm the fool
I'm tryna stop, but I still love you
