Skin to skin
Seepin' in
Flickering, our eyes go wide
You giving me studded sight
Painting stars
In our hearts
Yeah, you know I'm down for you
I want you to lick my wounds

What's your line though?
That I'm fine, oh
Heard that before
But somehow it means more

Dreamer, trippin' on your highs
These vibes, I feel 'em, ooh
Dreamer, trippin' on your highs
Feelin' all the vibes, ooh
Whisper pretty little things
Heart sings, I feel 'em, ooh
Dreamer, tripping on your highs
Feelin' all the vibes

Do ya? Do ya? Do ya?
Do you feel 'em too?
I feel ya, feel ya, feel ya
Feeling so high falling into you
Do ya? Do ya? Do ya?
Do you feel 'em too?
I feel ya, feel ya, feel ya
Feeling so high falling into you

Break away
All the things stopping me from letting go
Temperature is taking hold
Heart beating faster and faster
I'll be your (you'll be my) brand new disaster
But I don't know
Seems like what you're looking for

What's your type, though?
Am I right? No
Heard that before
Still you want it more

Dreamer, trippin' on your highs
These vibes, I feel 'em, ooh
Dreamer, trippin' on your highs
Feelin' all the vibes, ooh
Whisper pretty little things
Heart sings, I feel 'em, ooh
Dreamer, tripping on your highs
Feelin' all the vibes

Do ya? Do ya? Do ya?
Do you feel 'em too?
I feel ya, feel ya, feel ya
Feeling so high falling into you
Do ya? Do ya? Do ya?
Do you feel 'em too?
I feel ya, feel ya, feel ya
Feeling so high falling into you


What's your type, though?
Am I right? No
Heard that before
But still you want it more

Dreamer, trippin' on your highs
These vibes, I feel 'em, ooh
Dreamer, trippin' on your highs
Feelin' all the vibes, ooh
Whisper pretty little things
Heart sings, I feel 'em, ooh
Dreamer, tripping on your highs
Feelin' all the vibes
Tell me

Do ya? Do ya? Do ya?
Do you feel 'em too?
I feel ya, feel ya, feel ya
Feeling so high falling into you
Do ya? Do ya? Do ya?
Do you feel 'em too?
I feel ya, feel ya, feel ya
Feeling so high falling into you
