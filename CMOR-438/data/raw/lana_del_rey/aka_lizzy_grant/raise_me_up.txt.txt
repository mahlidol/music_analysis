It's like you said
It's all been done before
I don't have to talk pretty for them no more
It's like you said
It's all been done before
I don't have to talk pretty for them no more

I can talk what I want
How I wanna

No, no, no
I said no

It's the voodoo
Mississippi south
69 million stars
Birds are flying out of my mouth
Spirits creeping in my yard
Hold my head
It's tilting back
Something's dancing me around
Putting crystals on our neck
Lifting my feet off
The ground, the ground

Ray, Ray
Ray, raise me up
Ray, ray
Ray, raise me up
Ray, raise me up
Ray, raise me up

Oh see
Look what you done now
Oh me
That's what I'm talking 'bout
Oh me
Look what you done now
Oh me
It's what I'm talking 'bout
It's what I'm talking 'bout
It's what I'm talking about

I can talk what I want
How I wanna
I can talk what I want
How I wanna
I can talk what I want
How I wanna
I don't have to talk taste for your mama
No, no, no
I said no

I can talk what I want
How I wanna
I can talk what I want
How I wanna
I can talk what I want
How I wanna
I don't have to talk taste for your mama
No, no, no
I said no

Pick me up
In a pickup truck
Roll it down
You got it going on
Let me talk on your CB-walkie
Let me play with your new
Shotgun
Shotgun

Ray, Ray
Ray, raise me up
Ray, raise me up
Ray, ray
Ray, raise me up
Ray, raise me up

Ray, Ray
