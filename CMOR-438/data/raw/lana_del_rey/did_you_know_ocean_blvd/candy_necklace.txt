White flowers, cinnamon on my teeth
And I'm sittin' at a stoplight in northern town
I feel lucky
I drive somewhere out of range, I don't know where
White noise coming out of my brain
Turns off for nothing

Rockefella, my umbrella
God, I love you, baby
Storyteller, us forever
Is my favorite song

You've been acting pretty restless
Dancin' like the young and restless
And I'm obsessed with it
Candy necklaces
You've been acting pretty reckless
Dancing like the young and restless
And I'm obsessed with this
All his candy necklaces

Sittin' on the sofa, feelin' super suicidal
Hate to say the word, but, baby, hand on the Bible
I do feel like it's you the one who's bringing me down
Thought that we were cool, we were kicking it like Tribe Called Quest
You're the best, but, baby, you've been bringing me down
I can see it now

Rockafella, my umbrella
God I love you, baby
Fortune teller, favorite ever
Was the story of us

You've been acting pretty restless
Dancin' like the young and reckless
And I'm obsessed with this
Candy necklaces
I think that we should address this
Acting like the young and restless
I'm obsessed with this
All his candy necklaces

We've been acting pretty restless
Dancin' like the young and restless
I'm obsessed with this
Candy necklaces

Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces (Mm)
Candy necklaces (Mhm)
Candy necklaces (I'm obsessed with this)
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces ('Cause I'm obsessed with this)
Candy necklaces (Mm)
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces, oh
