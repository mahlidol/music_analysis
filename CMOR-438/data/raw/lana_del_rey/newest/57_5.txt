I go ATVing
I can turn a party out of every night
I still talk to Jesus, yes
But I still call up psychics when I need advice

I still fly commercial
You need an autograph? Shit, I don't mind
If you want the secret to success
I suggest showing up in a Ross dress

I've got 57.5 million listeners on Spotify
Roger Miller made 'em laugh
I guess some folks still like to cry
I ain't got a man but maybe one of them's a fan of mine
In that 57.5 million listeners on Spotify

I hate everybody
Lately, feels like everybody's loving me
Kinda feels like sugar
Sprinkled on the same wound they cut to deep

Doesn't really matter
They mind their own business and I'll mind mine
If you want the secret to success
I suggest stop trying to hit it big time

I've got 57.5 million listeners on Spotify
Roger Miller made 'em laugh
I guess some folks still like to cry
I ain't got a man but maybe one of them's a fan of mine
In that 57.5 million listeners on Spotify

Ooh, ooh
Round 'em up, round 'em up, they want the spotlight
Like ooh, ooh
Round 'em up, round 'em up, they want the spotlight

I kissed Morgan Wallen
I guess kissing me kind of went to his head
If you want my secret to success
I suggest don't go ATVing with him when you're out west
(Look at me!)

I've got 57.5 million listeners on Spotify
Roger Miller made 'em laugh
I guess some folks still like to cry
Now I got a man he really wasn't a fan of mine
In that 57.5 million listeners on Spotify

Ooh, ooh
Round 'em up, round 'em up, into the spotlight
Like ooh, ooh
Round 'em up, round 'em up, they want the spotlight
