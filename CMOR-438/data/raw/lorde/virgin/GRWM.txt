Soap, washing him off my chest
Keeping it light, not overthinking it
Jumping from stone to stone in the riverbed, I guess

Maybe you finally know who you wanna be
A grown woman in a baby tee
A grown woman, ah, ah, ah, ah
Girl's a grown woman, ah, ah, ah, ah

Wide hips, tooth chipped, '96
Skin scarred, looking forward
Wide hips, soft lips, my mama's trauma
Since '96, been looking for a grown woman
A grown woman

Pink galaxy left undressed
2009 me'd be so impressed (So impressed, oh)
Back when the stolen spirits went straight to the head
Maybe you'll finally know who you wanna be
A grown woman in a baby tee

A grown woman, ah, ah, ah, ah
Girl's a grown woman, ah, ah, ah, ah

Wide hips, tooth chipped, '96
Skin scarred, looking forward
Wide hips, soft lips, my mama's trauma
Since '96, been looking for a grown woman
A grown woman
A grown woman

Been looking for a, looking for a
Been looking for a (A grown woman)
I've been looking for a, been looking for
Grown woman
I can't find a grown woman
