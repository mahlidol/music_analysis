Mystique is dead
Last year was bad
I let myself get
Sucked in by arithmetic
Felt great to strip
New waist to hip
I hate to admit
Just how much I paid for it

Did I cry myself to sleep about that?
Cheat about that?
Rot teeth about that?
Did I sweat hours a week about that?
Compete about that?
Lose my freak about that?
Huh, all of the above

I wanna punch the mirror
To make her see that this won't last
It might be months of bad luck
But what if it's just broken glass?
I spent my summer getting lost in math
Making weight took all I had
Won't outrun her if you don't hit back
It's just broken glass

I'm scared to quit
Loosen my grip
It's tough to admit
Just how much I get from it

When I cry myself to sleep about that
Cheat about that
Get in too deep about that
When I sweat hours a week about that
Compete about that
Lettin' her treat me like that
I think that it's love

I wanna punch the mirror
To make her see that this won't last
It might be months of bad luck
But what if it's just broken glass?
I spent my summer getting lost in math
Making weight took all I had
Won't outrun her if you don't hit back
It's just broken glass

Keep the faith (Broken glass)
Same mistakes (Broken glass)
Just a phase (Broken glass)
Just a phase

I wanna punch the mirror
To make her see that this won't last
It might be months of bad luck
But what if it's just broken glass?
I spent my summer getting lost in math
Making weight takes all you had
Won't outrun her if you don't hit back
It's just broken glass
