After the ecstasy, testing for pregnancy, praying in MP3
I'm scared to let you see into the whole machine, leave it all on the field
Your metal detector hits my precious treasure, I'm nobody's daughter
Yeah, baby, I'm free, I'm free
Free, I'm free

But deep in my matter, you're changing my patterns
Your helix is right through me
Bars on my windows, you bust them wide open
'Til clearness is all I see
I'll try letting the answer be part of the dance as I trip and I stumble
Yeah, baby, I'm free, I'm free
I'm free

(Ah-ah-ah) Lips 'round your halo, you asked where I came from, I lied and then I came clean
(Ah-ah-ah) There's broken blood in me, it passed through my mother from her mother down to me
(Ah-ah-ah) I feel you answer, my hips moving faster, I rode you until I cried
(Ah-ah-ah) How's it feel being this alive?

Oh, where did it go?
Hah
Wish I'd kept the Clearblue
I'd remember how it feels to
Be so bare in the throes
Oh, I wish I'd kept the Clearblue
I'd remember how it feels to be
