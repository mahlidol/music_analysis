Knew when I felt it hit
Stood in the park under the eclipse
It was only a field trip
'Til it cooled my blood
That's how it tends to start
You're in the light, then you're in the dark
Then someone throws a flare
You tasted my underwear
I knew we were fucked

My bed is on fire
Mama, I'm so scared
Don't know how to come back
Once I get out on the edge
He spit in my mouth like
He's saying a prayer
But now I'm crying on the phone
Swearing nothing's wrong
Blame it on

Uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Current affairs (Girl, your pussy good, it grip me good a me fi tell you)
Uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Current affairs (Girl, your pussy good, it grip me good a me fi tell you)
Uh-uh, uh-uh-uh

All alone in my room
Watching the tape of their honeymoon
On the boat, it was pure and true
Then the film came out
Hope that we can ignore (Oh-oh-oh)
Voices we hear through the open door (Oh-oh-oh)
Would you dive to the ocean floor
Just to take my pearl?

'Cause my bed is on fire ('Cause my bed is on fire)
Mama, I'm so scared (Mama, I'm so scared)
Were you ever like this (Were you ever like this?)
Once you went out on the edge?
He spit in my mouth like
He's saying a prayer (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
But now I'm crying on the phone
Swearing nothing's wrong
Blame it on

Uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Current affairs (Affairs)
But now I'm high enough to know (Affairs)
Yeah, I think he's gon' blame it on
Ah-ah, ah, ah, ah-ah

Uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Current affair-air-airs (Girl, your pussy good, it grip me good a me fi tell you)
Current affair-airs (Girl, your pussy good, it grip me good a me fi tell you)
Uh-uh, uh-uh-uh

Current affairs
Affairs
