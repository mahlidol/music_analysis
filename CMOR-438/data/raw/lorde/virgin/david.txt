Oh, dark day
Was I just someone to dominate?
Worthy opponent, flint to my blade, now we're playing with shadows
At the Sunset Tower, you said, "Open your mouth"
I did

And what came spilling out that day was the truth
If I'd had virginity, I would have given that too

Why do we run to the ones we do?
I don't belong to anyone, ooh

Oh, dark day
Was I just young blood to get on tape?
'Cause you dimed me out when it got hard
Uppercut to the throat, I was off guard
Pure heroine mistaken for featherweight

But what came spilling out that day was the truth
And once I could sing again, I swore I'd never let
Let myself sing again for you, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh
Sing it

Said, "Why do we run to the ones we do?"
I don't belong to anyone, ooh
I made you God 'cause it was all
That I knew how to do
But I don't belong to anyone, ooh

Am I ever gonna love again?
Am I ever gonna love again?
Am I ever gonna love again? Ooh
Am I ever gonna love again? (Am I ever gonna love again? Tell it to the rock doves)
Will you ever feel like a friend? (Sing it to the fountain)
Am I ever gonna love again?
Do you understand? ('Til you understand)
Tell it to 'em
