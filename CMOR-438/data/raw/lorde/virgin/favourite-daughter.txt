I was a singer
You were my fan
When no one gave a damn
It was you in the dark
Scared of your anger
In love with your whim
Some notes I don't hit
But I don't give up

Now every day the plane takes off
And every night the room fills up with
People who are convinced I'm not
Just some kid fakin' it for your love

'Cause I'm an actress, all of the medals I won for ya
Breaking my back just to be your favourite daughter
Everywhere I run, I'm always runnin' to ya
Breaking my back just hoping you'll say I'm a star

You had a brother, I look like him
You told us as kids
"He died of a broken heart"
And for every door you open
There's a room I can't go in
I break in, I still can't find you

Now that every day the plane takes off
And every night the room fills up
I tell myself that soon we'll talk
Then I sing every word just to ya

'Cause I'm an actress, all of the medals I won for ya
Panic attack just to be your favourite daughter
Everywhere I run, I'm always runnin' to ya
Breaking my back to carry the weight of your heart

But I keep dancing till I get sick
Why'd you have to dream so big?
Why did no one listen when you hit the notes from your heart?
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah

I'm a good actress, look at the medals I won for ya
So you could imagine being a favourite daughter
Everywhere I run, I'm always runnin' to ya
Breaking my back just to be as brave as my mother
