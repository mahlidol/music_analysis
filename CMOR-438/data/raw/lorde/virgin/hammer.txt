There's a heat in the pavement, my mercury's raising
Don't know if it's love or if it's ovulation
When you're holding a hammer, everything looks like a nail
The mist from the fountain is kissing my neck
The liquid crystal is in my grip
Anyone with a snake tongue, I show 'em the chambers of my heart

Now I know you don't deal much in love and affection
But I really do think there could be a connection
I burn, and I sing, and I scheme, and I dance
Some days, I'm a woman, some days, I'm a man, oh

I might have been born again
I'm ready to feel like I don't have the answers
There's peace in the madness over our heads
Let it carry me o-o-o-o-on

On
Ah
Ah

Today, I'll go to Canal Street, they're piercing my ears
I'm making a wish when the needle goes in
Take an aura picture, read it, and tell me who I am (Show me who I am)

Now I know you don't deal much in love and affection
But I really do think you can make an exception
It's a beautiful life, so I play truant
I jerk tears, and they pay me to do it, oh

I might have been born again
I'm ready to feel like I don't have the answers
There's peace in the madness over our heads
Let it carry me o-o-o-o-on

On
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah

Let it break me down till I'm just a wreck
Till I'm just a voice living in your head
It's a fucked-up world, been to hell and back
But I've sent you a postcard from the edge
The edge
Mm, oh
Oh
