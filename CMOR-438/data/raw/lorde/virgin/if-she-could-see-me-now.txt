In the city, I hear the voices of the ancients, they're calling for us
Hear their horses running up Prince Street
'Cause I'm a mystic, I swim in waters
That would drown so many other bitches
Got me lifted, feeling so gifted, ah-ah-ah
Mm-mm, mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm

In the gym, I'm exorcising all my demons, make 'em keep riding
Yesterday I lifted your body weight
I pick a song and I listen to it
Until it's just a piece of music
And everything else falls away
Ah-ah, ah-ah

Baby, whenever you'd break me I'd watch it happen, like an angel looking down
Ah-ah, ah
Yeah, baby, I wanna be hurt like that
I can feel, don't need fantasy
Oh, God, if she could see me now

Hope you find (Na-na-na-na) another starlet (Na-na-na-na)
Another camera (Na-na-na-na), another red carpet (Na-na-na-na)
As for me (Na-na-na-na), I'm going back to the clay, uh-na-na
You can tell them (Na-na-na-na) I went crazy
If that's what this is, then I guess I'll take it
I bring the pain out the synthesizer
The bodies move like there's spirits inside 'em

Baby, whenever you break me
I'd watch it happen, like an angel looking down
And, baby, I wanna be hurt like that
I can feel, don't need fantasy
Oh, God, if she could see me now
Oh, God, if she could see me now
Oh, God, if she could see me now (Ah)
Oh, God, if she could see me now
(Oh, God, oh, God)
