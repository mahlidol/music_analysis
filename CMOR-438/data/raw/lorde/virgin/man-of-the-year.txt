Glidin' through on my bike, glidin' through
Like new from my recent ego death
Sirens sing overnight, violent, sweet music
You met me at a really strange time in my life
Take my knife and I cut the cord
My babe can't believe I've become someone else
Someone more like myself

Who's gon' love me like this?
Oh-oh, oh, who could give me lightness?
Let it flow down to me
Love me like this
Now I'm broken open?
Mm-mm, uh-huh-uh

Now I go 'bout my day riding it like a wave
Playing it any way I want
Swish mouthwash, jerk off
Uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Days go by in the haze (Ts, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh)
Stay up and sleep late (Ts, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh)
(Ts, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh)
(Ts, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh)

Who's gon' love me like this?
Oh-oh, oh, who could give me lightness?
Way he flow down through me
Love me like this
Now I'm broken open
Let's hear it for the man of the year
Mm-mm, uh-huh-uh
Hear it for the man of the year
Mm-mm, uh-huh-uh

How I hope that I'm remembered
My gold chain, my shoulders, my face in the light, oh
I didn't think he'd appear
Let's hear it for the man of the year
Hear it for the man of the year
Let's hear it for the man of the year
