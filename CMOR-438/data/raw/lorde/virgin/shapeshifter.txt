Ah

Chewing gum, I know
Don't have the sour taste that's in my throat
But the voice in my head says, "Do you have the stones?"
When you get close enough
I'll let down my braids and you'll climb up
In my room we can do anything you want

Everyone that I've slept with
All the pairs of hands, I'm reckless
If I'm fine without it, why can't I stop?
Everything I want speeding up my pulse
I don't sleep, don't dream at all
Give 'em nothing personal
So I'm not affected

I've been the ice, I've been the flame
I've been the prize, the ball, the chain
I've been the dice, the magic eight
So I'm not affected
I've been the siren, been the saint
I've been the fruit that leaves a stain
I've been up on the pedestal
But tonight I just wanna fall

Tonight I just wanna fall
Yeah, tonight I just wanna fall

Mirror, mirror, on his shirt
I see a hot mess in an antique skirt
But the voice in my head says
"Don't let him leave alone"
I become her again (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Visions of a teenage innocence (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
How'd I shift shape like that?

Everyone that I've slept with
All the metal that I've messaged
If I'm fine without it, why can't I stop?
Everything I want speeding up my pulse
I don't sleep, don't dream at all
Give 'em nothing personal
So I'm not affected

I've been the ice, I've been the flame
I've been the prize, the ball, the chain
I've been the dice, the magic eight
So I'm not affected
I've been the siren, been the saint (All shapes of)
I've been the fruit that leaves a stain (Shapeshifter)
I've been up on the pedestal
But tonight I just wanna fall

Yeah, tonight I just wanna fall
Yeah, tonight I just wanna fall

I'll kick you out and pull you in
Swear that you were just a friend
And when it's all over again
Say I'm not affected
I'll kick you out and pull you in (Ah, shapeshifter)
Swear that you were just a friend (Shapeshifter)
And when it's all over again (Ah-ah)
Say I'm not affected (Ah-ah)

Ah-ah
Ah-ah
No, I'm not affected
But tonight, I just wanna fall (I'm not affected)
