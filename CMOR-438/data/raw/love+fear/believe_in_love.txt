You say that I'm different to the girls you dated
You say that you found me, I'm the one you waited for (On and on)
Guess I need to trust you when you say you love me
Every day you say that you've been thinking of me, on (On and on)

And my mood, it changes all the time
I smile with tears in my eyes
But I can't be acting like this
Doubting you for the rest of my life

Ooh, I need to believe in love
Why is what you give never enough?
Losing you is what I'm afraid of
I need to believe, believe in love

Stuck on fast forward, always on the rewind
I don't trust my head, no, I don't trust my damn mind, no (No more)
Try delete my memories, throw away the blueprint
Looking for a remedy, want it to be different from (From now on)

'Cause my mood, it changes all the time
I smile with tears in my eyes
But I can't be acting like this
Doubting you for the rest of my life

Ooh, I need to believe in love
Why is what you give never enough?
Losing you is what I'm afraid of
I need to believe, believe in love

Don't wanna look back when I'm older on what didn't happen
Let go of my thoughts, let 'em fly away, swear I'll be better
Shouldn't take fear so seriously
Mmm, seriously

Ooh, I need to believe in love
Why is what you give never enough? (Never enough)
Losing you is what I'm afraid of
I need to believe, believe in love

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
