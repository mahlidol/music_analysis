End of the-
End of the-
End of the-
End of the-
Earth

Love can never be what you want it to be
But I'd still follow you down
Slow motion, no sound
'Till the edge of the world
Hmm, tell me why do we fight?

We're all living in the same universe
Where the stars collide as the planets turn
But I'll give my love, I don't care if it hurts
'Cause I'll love you 'till the end
I'll love you 'till the end of the earth

Do you ever think how this life could've been?
If you never took the chance, a leap of faith and danced
With losing it all
So just wait, wait for me

We're all living in the same universe
Where the stars collide as the planets turn
But I'll give my love, I don't care if it hurts
'Cause I'll love you 'till the end

If we're torn apart then I won't let go
'Cause wherever we are, it feels like home
And I love you 'till the end
I'll love you 'till the end
Of the-
End of the-
End of the-
End of the-

I'll love you 'till the end
But I'll give my love, I don't care if it hurts
'Cause I'll love you 'till the end of the earth
('Cause I'll love you 'till the end of the earth)
(But I'll give my love, I don't care if it hurts)
'Cause I'll love you 'till the end of the earth
