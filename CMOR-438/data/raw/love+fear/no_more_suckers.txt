I was too open, I was too quick
To let other people in, took whatever they could get
Now I see a pattern, I'm getting rid of it
Yeah, I know I need a change 'cause I'm tired of feeling drained

Put a stop sign up, you're not getting any nearer
Wave goodbye to the suckers in my rear-view mirror
Don't reply to your texts, can I make it any clearer?
Why can't you help yourself?

No more suckers in my life
All the drama gets them high
I'm just trying to draw the line
No more suckers in my life
They just keep bleeding me dry
'Til there's nothing left inside

Every time I meet you, I know what to expect
Never ask me how I am, yeah, you never get the cheque
When you stay over, you eat all of my food
Yeah, you mess up all my towels, but this time, I'm checking out

Put a stop sign up, you're not getting any nearer
Wave goodbye to the suckers in my rear-view mirror
Don't reply to your texts, can I make it any clearer?
Why can't you help yourself?

No more suckers in my life
All the drama gets them high
I'm just trying to draw the line
No more suckers in my life
They just keep bleeding me dry
'Til there's nothing left inside

You touch like a leech and I'm left with the bruising
Trying to find a fix, but you're always using me
'Til I'm weak, 'til I need a transfusion
Why can't you help yourself?

No more suckers in my life
All the drama gets them high
I'm just trying to draw the line
No more suckers in my life
They just keep bleeding me dry
I've got nothing left inside

No more suckers, ooh
No more suckers
No more suckers, ooh
No more suckers
