I wanna change but I don't know how
I've been trying to turn my life around
I've been to every party, every bar
Nothing thrills me in this city anymore

I guess I didn't know if I was happy (ah)
I can't pretend, I can't pretend
Been feeling like I don't belong
And I see (ah) I've reached an end, I've reached an end

What, well what can I do?
I hate this city but I stay 'cause of you
Why, well why can't I change?
I wanna move on but I'm just too afraid

Just too afraid
Just too afraid
Just too afraid
That's why I stay

Get on the train, I go underground
People look so lonely, with eyes turned down
This isn't living, this isn't how
I thought my life would be
God I need to get out

Nothing's gonna change the way I feel (ah)
I can't pretend, I've reached an end

What, well what can I do?
I hate this city but I stay 'cause of you
Why, well why can't I change?
I wanna move on but I'm just too afraid

Just too afraid
Just too afraid
Just too afraid
That's why I stay
Just too afraid
Just too afraid
Just too afraid
That's why I stay

Aah, it could all be different
Aah, in this life
Change your future in an instant
Aah, just to feel alive

What, well what can I do?
I hate this city but I stay 'cause of you
Why, well why can't I change?
I wanna move on but I'm just too afraid

Just too afraid
Just too afraid
Just too afraid
That's why I stay
Just too afraid
Just too afraid
Just too afraid
That's why I stay

That's why I stay
That's why I stay
