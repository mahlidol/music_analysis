Everybody tells us what to do, do, do
Think they always know what's good for you, you, you
We know they don't really have a clue, clue, clue
Ooh-ooh-ooh
People like to tell you what to think, think, think
Sometimes it feels right to do the wrong, wrong thing
Let it go and listen to your own instincts
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Cause you don't need nobody else
When you are true, true to yourself
You're skin and bone, you're full of fear
But you are just a human being
(No matter what they do)

Always said we're gonna be true
We will never change, we will never change
They can never do it better
Than when we are, are together
Always said we are gonna be true
We will never change, we will never change
They can never do it better
Than when we are, are together

Don't need to add nothing on your skin, skin, skin
Be happy with the body that you're in, in, in
Being who you are don't cost a thing, thing, thing
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Cause you don't need nobody else
When you are true, true to yourself
You're skin and bone, you're full of fear
But you are just a human being
(No matter what they do)

Always said we're gonna be true
We will never change, we will never change
They can never do it better
Than when we are, are together
Always said we are gonna be true
We will never change, we will never change
They can never do it better
Than when we are, are together

Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
No matter what they do

Always said we're gonna be true
We will never change, we will never change
They can never do it better
Than when we are, are together
Always said we are gonna be true
We will never change, we will never change
They can never do it better
Than when we are, are together

Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
