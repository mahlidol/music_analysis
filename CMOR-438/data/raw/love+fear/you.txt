(You)

You don't know me like you think you do
You don't own me, but I can't cut you loose

Everybody thinks that you're a star
But underneath I see just what you are
We both know that we can never change
Walking slowly through the smoke and flames

You, yeah, you break me down (You)
Yeah, you shut me out (You)
But it's all about you, you (You)
I know what you're about (You)
But I need you now (You)
'Cause it's all about you, you (You)

You (You, you)
You (You, you)

You don't love me like you think you do
You don't know I'm just as bad as you

Everybody thinks that I'm the heart
Of every party, but it's just the start
Deep down, I know that we're just the same
Burning slowly through the dust and flames

You, yeah, you break me down (You)
Yeah, you shut me out (You)
But it's all about you (You)
I know what you're about (You)
But I need you now (You)
'Cause it's all about you (You)

You (You, you)
You (You, you)
You (You, you)
You (You, you)

You don't know me like you think you do
You don't know I'm just as bad as you

You, yeah, you break me down (You)
Yeah, you shut me out (You)
But it's all about you (You)
I know what you're about (You)
But I need you now (You)
'Cause it's all about you (You)

You (You, you)
You (You, you)
You (You, you)
You (You, you)

You don't know me like you think you do
