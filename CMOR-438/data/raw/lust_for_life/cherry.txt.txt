Love (Yeah), I said real love is like feeling no fear
When you're standing in the face of danger (Hey)
'Cause you just want it so much
A touch (Yeah) from your real love
Is like heaven taking the place of something evil (Hey)
And letting it burn off from the rush, yeah, yeah (Fuck)

Darling, darling, darling
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
I fall to pieces
My cherries (Hey) and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined

Love (Yeah), is it real love?
It's like smiling when the firing squad's against ya (Hey)
And you just stay lined up, yeah (Fuck)

Darling, darling, darling
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
I fall to pieces (Bitch)
My cherries (Hey) and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches (Can I get a fucking hallelujah?)
Are ruined (Bitch) (Looking at me like a magazine)

My rose garden dreams (Can I get a fucking hallelujah?)
Set on fire by fiends (Sipping on ya like a Coca-Cola)
And all my black beaches (Can I get a fucking hallelujah?)
Are ruined (Looking at me like a magazine)
My celluloid scenes (Can I get a fucking hallelujah?)
Are torn at the seams (Sipping on ya like a Coca-Cola, yeah)
And I fall to pieces (Bitch)
(Yeah) I fall to pieces when I'm with you

(Why?) 'Cause I love you so much (Hey)
I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme (Yeah)
And all of my peaches are ruined (Bitch)
Are ruined (Bitch), are ruined (Fuck)
