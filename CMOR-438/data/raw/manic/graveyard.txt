It's crazy when
The thing you love the most
Is the detriment
Let that sink in

You can think again
When the hand you want to hold
Is a weapon and
You're nothin' but skin

Oh, 'cause I keep digging myself down deeper
I won't stop till I get where you are
I keep running, I keep running, I keep running

They say I may be making a mistake
I woulda followed all the way
No matter how far
I know when you go
Down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard

Oh, 'cause I keep digging myself down deeper
I won't stop till I get where you are
I keep running when both my feet hurt
I won't stop till I get where you are

Oh, when you go
Down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard

You look at me
With eyes so dark
I don't know how you even see
You push right through me (push right through me)

It's getting real
You lock the door
You're drunk at the steering wheel
And I can't conceal

Oh, 'cause I've been digging myself down deeper
I won't stop till I get where you are
I keep running, I keep running, I keep running

They say I may be making a mistake
I woulda followed all the way
No matter how far
I know when you go
Down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard

Oh, 'cause I keep digging myself down deeper
I won't stop till I get where you are
I keep running when both my feet hurt
I won't stop till I get where you are

Oh, when you go
Down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard

Oh, it's funny how
The warning signs can feel
Like they're butterflies

Oh, 'cause I keep digging myself down deeper
I won't stop till I get where you are
I keep running when both my feet hurt
I won't stop till I get where you are

Oh, when you go
Down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard
