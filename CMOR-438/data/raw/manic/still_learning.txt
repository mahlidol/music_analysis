I should be living the dream
But I'm living with a security team
And that ain't gonna change, no
I got a paranoia in me
And you wouldn't believe
Everything that I've seen, no
Coming apart at the seams

And no one around me knows
Who I am, what I'm on
Who I've hurt and where they've gone
I know that I've done some wrong
But I'm trying to make it right
to the one I love bring me around
get me out right now

I know that I love you but I'm still learning
To love myself (To love my, to love my, to love my)
I'm still learning to love myself (To love my, to love my, to love my)

I should be living the dream
But I go home and I got no self-esteem (Nope)
You think I'm swimming in green, but
It's passed around my family tree
No man wants to really commit
Intimidated 'cause I get paid and shit
In the crowd you're reading my lips, but
No one around me knows

Who I am, what I'm on
Who I've hurt and where they've gone
I know that I've done some wrong
But I'm trying to make it right
The same mistakes on and on
To all my friends I'm sorry for
And know that I love you
But I'm still learning to love myself (To love my, to love my, to love my)
I'm still learning to love myself (To love my, to love my, to love my)

Oh, I try and I try
To remember sometimes
If I breathe it's alright
Some things don't change
I'm still learning to love myself (To love my, to love my, to love my)

Who I am, what I'm on
Who I've hurt and where they've gone
I know that I've done some wrong
But I'm trying to make it right
To the one I love bring me around
Get me out right now

I'm still learning to love myself (To love my, to love my, to love my)
I'm still learning to love myself (To love my, to love my, to love my)
And I try and I try
To remember sometimes
If I breathe it's alright
Some things don't change
I'm still learning to love myself (To love myself, I'm tryin' to love myself)
I'm still learning to love myself
