Now we reached the end
I ran the marathon
The road had many bends
But we knew that all along
I think it made me stronger
But I would rather not
Betray myself, just to keep your love at any cost

And it's most tempting to give in
When you hear the firin' shots
When you're steps from winning back
All the happiness you lo-o-o-ost, lo-o-o-o-ost
Lo-o-o-ost, lo-o-o-o-ost

With every careless action you let me slip away
If you just bought me flowers, maybe I would've stayed
You didn't think I was serious, I guess you felt so safe
If you just bought me flowers, maybe I would've stayed

Maybe I would've stayed
Maybe I would've stayed

The seeds we planted grew
But not like roses do
We had the thorns and leaves
But the buds, they never bloomed
And now my future gleams
With colors bold and bright
In a home that's filled with love and hope
And a life that just feels right

And it's most tempting to give in
When you're almost at the top
When you're steps from winning back
All the happiness you lo-o-o-ost, lo-o-o-o-ost
Lo-o-o-ost, lo-o-o-o-ost

With every careless action you let me slip away
If you just bought me flowers, maybe I would've stayed
You didn't think I was serious, I guess you felt so safe
If you just bought me flowers, maybe I would've stayed

Maybe I would've stayed
Maybe I would've stayed
I wouldn't have walked away
I wouldn't have walked away

And there's no heartbreak left to feel
It happened years ago
After you made your choices
I melted away like snow
'Cause you like lying to yourself
And now I'll never know
What parts of your love were for real
And what parts were for show

With every careless action you let me slip away
If you just bought me flowers, maybe I would've stayed
You didn't think I was serious, I guess you felt so safe
If you just bought me flowers, maybe I would've stayed

Maybe I would've stayed
Maybe I would've stayed
I wouldn't have walked away
I wouldn't have walked away
