Heaven, if there's a star for us
Up there in your lovers' universe
Shine your light down on me
Somewhere between new and old
Another life waits to unfold
Maybe one day if we're lucky

I fucked it up, I lost it all
And my life might not be what I thought
But I wouldn't change a thing
Goodbye to the girl that I'd been

Goodbye to the girl that I was
Goodbye to the girl that you lost
I will never be yours again
Never wanted our love to end
Goodbye my friend

Maybe we won't meet again
But you'll always be my closest friend
I hope you'll always be happy
Some mistakes are hard to learn
And broken hearts are quick to burn
And slow to heal easily

I've been a mother to everyone else
To every motherfucker except myself
And I don't even have any kids
Goodbye to the girl that I'd been

Goodbye to the girl that I was
Goodbye to the girl that you lost
I will never be yours again
Never wanted our love to end
Goodbye my friend
Goodbye

No matter what happens now
Nobody can take our love down
It's safe inside our memories
And I won't forget how you healed me

Goodbye
Goodbye
I will never be yours again
Never wanted our love to end
Goodbye my friend

It's time
I will never be yours again
Never wanted our love to end
Goodbye my friend

My friend, friend, mmm-mm-mmh
My friend, friend, mmm-mm-mmh
Mmm-mmh, mmh, mmm-mm-mmh
Mmm-mmh, mmh, mmm-mm-mmh
