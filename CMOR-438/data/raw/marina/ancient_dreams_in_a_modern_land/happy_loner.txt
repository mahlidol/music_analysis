Waking up late, I feel demotivated
Everything's wrong, guess my thoughts escalated
When I'm alone, things are under control
When I'm alone, I can turn off the world

I try to escape, but I can't lose my mind
That's why I can live a conventional life

'Cause I'm happy being a loner
Happy being a loner
I'm sick of it all, I wanna give it up
But I'm on the edge
And I feel like everything's too much, too much, hmm
Too much, too much, hmm

They don't understand, why I like being alone
I don't wanna be so accessible
Emotionally I'm on the edge of a knife
That's how I learn, that's how I learn to survive

If I'm alone then you'll never find
The truth about me that I'm losing my mind
And it's too hard to pretend
So I stay away from my friends

'Cause I'm happy being a loner
Happy being a loner
I'm sick of it all, I wanna give it up
But I'm on the edge
And I feel like everything's too much, too much, hmm
Too much, too much, hmm

I pick up on everybody's energy
Always used to feel like there was something wrong with me
(Wrong with me)
When the world is overwhelming, I need to breathe

'Cause I'm happy being a loner
Happy being a loner
I'm sick of it all, I wanna give it up
But I'm on the edge
And I feel like everything's too much, too much, hmm
Too much, too much, hmm
Too much, too much, hmm
Too much, too much, hmm
