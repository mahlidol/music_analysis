All my friends are witches and we live in Hollywood
Mystical bitches making our own sisterhood
While society is falling, we are quietly reforming
Protecting the planet, healing our own damage

Quarantined all alone, Mother Nature's on the phone
What have you been doing? Don't forget I am your home
Virus come, fires burn until human beings learn
From every disaster, you are not my master

Need to purge the poison, show us our humanity
All the bad and good, racism and misogyny
Nothing's hidden anymore, capitalism made us poor
God forgive America for every single war

Need to purge the poison from our system
Until human beings listen
Tell me, who d'you think you are?
It's your own decision
But your home is now your prison
You forgot that without me you won't go far

Need to purge the poison from our system
Until human beings listen
Tell me, who d'you think you are?

2007 when size zero was the rage
Britney shaved her head and all we did was call her crazed
Harvey Weinstein gone to jail
Me too went on to unveil
Truth in all its glory, the ending of a story

It's a New World Order, everything just falls away
Our life as we knew it now belongs to yesterday
Inside all the love and hate, we can now regenerate
Stop how we been living every single day

Need to purge the poison from our system
Until human beings listen
Tell me, who d'you think you are?
It's your own decision
But your home is now your prison
You forgot that without me you won't go far

Need to purge the poison from our system
Until human beings listen
Tell me, who d'you think you are?

I just want a world where I can see the feminine
We only make up one quarter of the government
Like an angel gone to hell, cast the moon under our spell
Owning female power, taking back what's ours

Earth is like a white rose, quiet cloud of petals cold
A place so corrupt where angels' flesh and blood is sold
The feminine is born as new, studded with a diamond dew
Saw the dawn was coming, everybody knew

Need to purge the poison from our system
Until human beings listen
Tell me, who d'you think you are?
It's your own decision
But your home is now your prison
You forgot that without me you won't go far

Need to purge the poison from our system
Until human beings listen
Tell me, who d'you think you are?
It's your own decision
But your home is now your prison
You forgot that without me you won't go far
