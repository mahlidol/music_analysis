Yeah... yeah... yeah...

Pink lipstick stains, cigarette butts
I lie in bed, I hate my guts
A day in the dark, a murdered afternoon, yeah
Oh baby, darling, how I'd love to become your suicide blonde
To lie beside my Romeo, oh what a wicked way to go

It only takes two lonely people
To fuck love up and make it evil
It only takes a drop of evil
To fuck up two beautiful people
L.O.V.E. L.O.V.E.
L.O.V.E. E.V.O.L.
L.O.V.E., do you love me?
L.O.V.E., love is evil

Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker
Every kiss you give me makes me sicker
A day in the dark, a day in a cloud of gloom, yeah
I look at you, you look at me
Milk and roses, squeaky clean
Well, you're the best I've ever seen
And I'm your dying beauty queen

It only takes two lonely people
To fuck love up and make it evil
It only takes a drop of evil
To fuck up two beautiful people
L.O.V.E. L.O.V.E.
L.O.V.E. E.V.O.L.
L.O.V.E., do you love me?
L.O.V.E., love is evil

Yeah... yeah... yeah...
Yeah... (L.O.V.E. E.V.O.L.)
Yeah... (L.O.V.E. E.V.O.L.)
Yeah... (L.O.V.E. E.V.O.L.)
(L.O.V.E. E.V.O.L.)

It only takes two lonely people
To fuck love up and make it evil
It only takes a drop of evil
To fuck up two beautiful people
L.O.V.E. L.O.V.E.
L.O.V.E. E.V.O.L.
L.O.V.E., do you love me?
L.O.V.E., love is evil

Do you, do you, do you love me?
L.O.V.E. E.V.O.L
Do you love me?
L.O.V.E., love is evil
