I’m Electra, I’m Electra Heart
Hey! Only living, living in the dark
Lights they blind me!

Can we go back, go back to the start?
Where the Holy Father made his mark
Lights they blind me!

Can we go back?...

Lights they blind me!

For forgiveness you could always pray
Hey! That the sickness it could go away
Lights they blind me!

At the altar would you pay the price?
Would you give your, would you give your life?
Lights they blind me! For forgiveness…

Lights they blind me!
Lights they blind me!
Lights they blind me!
