Everyday I feel the same
Stuck, and I can never change
Sucked into a black balloon
Spat into an empty room
But was it really worth it?
Did I really deserve it?
It happens when you're hurting
And cut me at the surface
Of my heart
Of my heart-heart-heart

I'm living dead, dead, dead, dead
Only alive-live-live-live
When I pretend-tend-tend-tend
That I have died, died, died, died, died, died
I haven't lived life
I haven't lived love
Just bird's eye view
From the sky above
I'm dead, dead, dead, dead
I'm living dead, dead, dead, dead
Dead

Got bubble wrap around my heart
Waiting for my life to start
But everyday it never comes
Permanently at square one
When it's late at night-ight
I'm so dissatisfied-ied
The weight of an empty life-ife
Will lessen in the moonlight
In the light
In the light-light-light

I'm living dead, dead, dead, dead
Only alive-live-live-live
When I pretend-tend-tend-tend
That I have died, died, died, died, died, died
I haven't lived life
I haven't lived love
Just bird's eye view
From the sky above
I'm dead, dead, dead, dead
I'm living dead, dead, dead, dead
Dead

I lay back in a glittering mist,
And I, I think of all the men I, I could have kissed
I haven't lived my life, I haven't lived love,
It's just a bird's eye view from, from up above

I'm living dead, dead, dead, dead
Only alive-live-live-live
When I pretend-tend-tend-tend
That I have died, died, died, died, died, died
I haven't lived life
I haven't lived love
Just bird's eye view
From the sky above
I'm dead, dead, dead, dead
I'm living dead, dead, dead, dead
Dead
