Couldn't relax, couldn't sit back
And let the sunlight in my lap
I sang a hymn to bring me peace
And then it came, a melody

It felt so sweet, it felt so strong
It made me feel like I belonged
And all the sadness inside me
Melted away like I was free

I found what I'd been looking for in myself
Found a life worth living for someone else
Never thought that I could be, I could be
Happy, happy

Don't go out much at all
I've never been the type to call
I realize to be happy
Maybe I need a little company

So now you know, you know it all
That I've been des-desperately alone
I haven't found the one for me
But I believe in divinity

I found what I'd been looking for in myself
Found a life worth living for someone else
Never thought that I could be, I could be
Happy, happy

I believe in possibility
I believe someone's watching over me
And finally I have found a way to be
Happy, happy

From the concrete to the coast
I was looking for a holy ghost
Like the land joining the sea
Happiness, it followed me

I believe in possibility
I believe someone's watching over me
And finally I have found a way to be
Happy, happy, happy
