It's hard to see
That you wanna be free
'Cause I don't love you
In the way that you want me to

Cut from devotion, lost in an ocean
Out of emotion for you

I'm a machine
An emotional being
Since I was a teen
Cut my feelings off clean, clean

It's no excuse
To treat me like you do
My perception is skewed
'Cause I know what you went through

Cut from devotion, lost in an ocean
Out of emotion for you

I'm a machine
An emotional being
Since I was a teen
Cut my feelings off clean, clean

Ooh...

Did you ever truly love me? (Did you ever truly love me?)
Were you just too scared to be free? (Wereyou just too scared to be free?)
My God is dying silently (my God is dying silently)
Nobody believes
Nobody believes

I'm a machine
An emotional being
Since I was a teen
Cut my feelings off clean, clean

I'm a machine (should I pretend that you didn't exist?)
An emotional being (should I act like you're somebody I miss?)
Since I was a teen (a velvet glove around an iron fist)
Cut my feelings off clean, clean (if you wanna survive, then ignorance is bliss)

Ooh...
