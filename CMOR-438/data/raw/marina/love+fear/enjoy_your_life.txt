I, I know
You've been feeling stuck, feeling low
You can't see
How good this life can be

Looking to the future like it's gonna make you happy
Save you from reality, yeah, yeah
Imagining the worst like it's gonna end so badly, yeah, yeah

(Mmm) sit back and enjoy your problems
(Oh) you don't always have to solve them
(Yeah) 'cause your worst days, they are over
So enjoy your life
(Mmm) yeah you might as well accept it
(Oh) don't you waste your time regretting
(Yeah) 'cause your worst days, they are over
So enjoy your life

Sun comes up
Your eyes they see clear
Take one breath
Your worries start to disappear

Looking to the future never seem to make you happy
Took you from reality, yeah, yeah
Imagining the worst like it's gonna end so badly, yeah, yeah

(Mmm) sit back and enjoy your problems
(Oh) you don't always have to solve them
(Yeah) 'cause your worst days, they are over
So enjoy your life
(Mmm) yeah you might as well accept it
(Oh) don't you waste your time regretting
(Yeah) 'cause your worst days, they are over
So enjoy your life

When we're down low
Everybody's moving, running slow-mo
Never think we get out of this black hole
But you're not living in this world alone, alone

(Mmm) sit back and enjoy your problems
(Oh) you don't always have to solve them
(Yeah, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh) 'cause your worst days, they are over
(Uh-uh-uh-uh) so enjoy your life
(Mmm) yeah you might as well accept it
(Oh) don't you waste your time regretting
(Yeah, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh) 'cause your worst days, they are over
(Uh-uh-uh-uh) so enjoy your life

(Mmm, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh) so enjoy your life
(Oh, uh-uh-uh-uh) so enjoy your life
(Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)
(Uh-uh-uh-uh)
So enjoy your life
