I know so many boys and girls
People all across the world
We walk and talk and think alike
We all cry the same tears at night

Ever since my dreams have changed
I'm crashing down like a paper plane
Nothing ever stays the same
But all I know is life is strange

Don't know what I'm doing with my life
But maybe there's no wrong or right
'Cause everybody feels the same
And all we know is life is strange (Ah)
All we know is life is strange (Ah)
All we know is life is strange

We're in the future, living fast
Can never make a moment last
Is it ever gonna be enough
To love another and be loved?

Ever since my dreams have changed
I'm crashing down like a paper plane
Nothing ever stays the same
But all I know is life is strange

Don't know what I'm doing with my life
But maybe there's no wrong or right
'Cause everybody feels the same
And all we know is life is strange (Ah)
All we know is life is strange (Ah)
All we know is life is strange

And I thought that I had lost my mind
Scared I was the only one
I didn't realize
Seems like everybody's having
The best time of their lives
But we don't know what's going on
At any given time

Don't know what I'm doing with my life
But maybe there's no wrong or right
'Cause everybody feels the same
And all we know is life is strange (Ah)
All we know is life is strange (Ah)
All we know is life is strange (Ah)
And all we know is life is strange (Ah)
All we know is life is strange
