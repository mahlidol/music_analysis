Oh-oh-oh-orange
Oh-oh-oh-orange
Oh-oh-oh-orange
Oh-oh-oh-orange

I can see the flowers in the greenery
I take a breath of air, I feel free
Spent so long, was busy chasing happiness
When all I needed was a little peace

Try to get back to what we need
(Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
Living like we're supposed to be

Flowers in my hair, I belong by the sea
Where we used to be, sitting by the orange trees
Summer in the air, bodies in the heat
Just you and me, sitting by the orange trees

Oh-oh-oh-orange
Oh-oh-oh-orange
Oh-oh-oh-orange
Oh-oh-oh-orange

So far away, from neon lights and city streets
This is where I used to dream
Been around the world, but I could never replicate
The feeling that I get beneath my feet

Try to get back to what we need
(Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
Living like we're supposed to be

Flowers in my hair, I belong by the sea
Where we used to be, sitting by the orange trees
Summer in the air, bodies in the heat
Just you and me, sitting by the orange trees

Oh-oh-oh-orange (Oh, oh)
Oh-oh-oh-orange (Oh-oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh-orange
Oh-oh-oh-orange

Watch the sun go down into the sea
Wrap your love around me
Life is beautiful and now you see
This is how it feels to be free

Flowers in my hair, I belong by the sea
Where we used to be, sitting by the orange trees
Summer in the air, bodies in the heat
Just you and me, sitting by the orange trees

Oh-oh-oh-orange
Oh-oh-oh-orange
Oh-oh-oh-orange
Oh-oh-oh-orange
