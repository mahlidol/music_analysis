I know it's hard to be soft
I know it hurts to be kind
I know that when love is lost
It's only fear in disguise

And I guess I've known it all along
The truth is you have to be soft to be strong
Finally, I feel the fear is gone
I found out love has to be soft to be strong
Soft to be strong, soft

I believe the world is beautiful
Only the weak ones are cruel
I choose to love you without fear
No shame in being sincere

And I guess I've known it all along
The truth is you have to be soft to be strong
Finally, I feel the fear is gone
I found out love has to be soft to be strong
Soft to be strong

And I made myself believe
Other people wanted to hurt me
I took my bitterness and made it sweet
I took a broken heart and made it beat
Somebody hurt me long ago
And though to heal a heart is slow
It's just a consequence of pain
There is no use in laying blame

And I guess I've known it all along
The truth is you have to be soft to be strong
Finally I feel the fear is gone
I found out love has to be soft to be strong
Soft to be strong

Soft to be strong
Soft to be strong
Soft
