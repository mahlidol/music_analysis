Before I met you, I pushed them all away
Soon as I kissed you I wanted you to stay
What I like about you is you know who you are
What you like about me is I know what I'm not

And I, I know that you never sleep, oh
So impossible to dream when you're far away from me
Oh, I, I'm all you could ever need, oh
So impossible to breathe
I love the way, I love the way we worked so hard
Yeah we've come so far
Baby, look at me, you're my superstar
When I'm afraid, when the world's gone dark
Come and save my day, you're my superstar

Superstar, superstar
Superstar, superstar

You never judge me for any of my fears
Never turn your back, always keep my body near
All of the days that we spend apart
My love is a planet revolving your heart

And I, I know that you never sleep, oh
So impossible to dream when you're far away from me
Oh, I, I'm all you could ever need, oh
So impossible to breathe
I love the way, I love the way we worked so hard
Yeah we've come so far
Baby, look at me, you're my superstar
When I'm afraid, when the world's gone dark
Come and save my day, you're my superstar

Superstar, superstar
Superstar, superstar

We'll stick together, make it through the storm
You and I
Whoever said we couldn't have it all

I love the way we worked so hard
Yeah we've come so far
Baby, look at me, you're my superstar
When I'm afraid, when the world's gone dark
Come and save my day, you're my superstar

Superstar, superstar
Superstar, superstar
