I'm gonna fall in love tonight
I've got my bow and arrow
My heart-shaped eyes are burning bright
I've got you in my sight
You're looking at my wings and by the look in your eyes
You've got an appetite
My love is ready to take flight
So dance into the light

Shoot you down with an arrow like dun-dun-dun
Make your heart beat faster like boom-boom-boom
'Cause you know you want me and you cannot resist
Yeah, I'm looking for a lover and you're top of my list

Cupid
You're so stupid
Trying to resist
My kiss
But you know I'll never miss
Baby, you just need to relax
Don't panic when it hits
Shoot my arrow right into your back

La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la

I wanna show you how to trust
Want you to see what love is
I wanna show you happiness
So you don't have to fear it

Shoot you down with an arrow like dun-dun-dun
Make your heart beat faster like boom-boom-boom
'Cause you know you want me and you cannot resist
Yeah, I'm looking for a lover and you're top of my list

Cupid
You're so stupid
Trying to resist
My kiss
But you know I'll never miss
Baby, you just need to relax
Don't panic when it hits
Shoot my arrow right into your back

La-la-la, la-la-la

You've fallen before and it hurt (Ah-ah-ah)
One too many lessons learnt (Ah-ah-ah)
But I can see your heart, it burns (Ah-ah-ah)
When's it gonna be your turn? (Ah-ah-ah)

Cupid
You're so stupid
Trying to resist
My kiss
But you know I'll never miss
Baby, you just need to relax
Don't panic when it hits
Shoot my arrow right into your back

La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
