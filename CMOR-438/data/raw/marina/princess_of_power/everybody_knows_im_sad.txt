Sometimes the truth is
I've got nobody to hang out with
I've got nobody to go watch a film on a Sunday, a Sunday
Sunday is for lovers

Sometimes the truth is
Don't wanna live anymore like this
'Cause I've been getting so lonely
And I've got nobody to hold me

Got no one to hold me

I try to hide it, protect my pride
So superficial, don't realise
I've been so lonely all of my life
Don't know if I can, I can survive
Maybe I'm not built for this kind of connection
Maybe I was born to live my life alone
I can't even look at my own reflection
Don't wanna admit that I've lost all hope

'Cause everybody knows I'm sad
They know I've never felt this bad
Everybody knows I'm sad
'Cause everybody knows I'm sad

Sometimes the truth is
I wanna leave everything behind
Maybe if I disappear
Then the black hole will clear inside of my mind
(As if that's gonna fix it)
I like to pretend that I'm better off on my own
I spend the weekend in my bed
I see none of my friends
So, I turn off my phone
'Cause no one's gonna miss me

I try to hide it, protect my pride
So superficial, don't realise
I've been so lonely all of my life
Don't know if I can, I can survive
Maybe I'm not built for this kind of connection
Why is to so hard to let myself get close?
I can't even look at my own reflection
Don't wanna admit that I've lost all hope

'Cause everybody knows I'm sad
They know I've never felt this bad
Everybody knows I'm sad
'Cause everybody knows I'm sad

Sometimes I wonder why
Why I'm alone
Alone at night
In a foreign city
Doesn't even matter if you're pretty
Doesn't matter what I do

'Cause everybody knows I'm sad
They know I've never felt this bad
Everybody knows I'm sad
'Cause everybody knows I'm
Sad
Sad
