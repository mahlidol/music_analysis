Babe, I'm intense
Don't you know what I meant?
When I say I like you, that means I'm obsessed
You're my one desire
I'm usually shy
Come in for the kill like I'm ready to die

Hunt you from afar like a jaguar
Till you say 'hello kitty'
Make me go 'rah rah'

Babe, I'm intense
Don't you know what I meant?
When I say I like you, that means I'm obsessed
You're my one desire
I'm usually shy
Come in for the kill like I'm ready to die

Hunt you from afar like a jaguar
Till you say 'hello kitty'
Make me go 'rah rah'
Catch me if you can
But I'm running fast
Till you say 'hello kitty'
Make me go 'rah rah'

Catch me if you can
Ain't no other man that could find me in the dark
Got nothing to fear
I can feel you near
Now you know the way to my heart

Please respect my space
It's not like me to attack
You can come back to my place
But you must like cats
Leave without a trace
I'm endangered, it's a fact
I'm just looking for my mate
But you must like cats

Babe, I'm intense
Don't you know what I meant?
When I say I like you, that means I'm obsessed
You're my one desire
I'm usually shy
Come in for the kill like I'm ready to die

Hunt you from afar like a jaguar
Till you say 'hello kitty'
Make me go 'rah rah'
Catch me if you can
But I'm running fast
Till you say 'hello kitty'
Make me go 'rah rah'

Catch me if you can
Ain't no other man that could find me in the dark
Got nothing to fear
I can feel you near
Now you know the way to my heart
Catch me if you can
Ain't no other man that could find me in the dark
Till you say 'hello kitty'
Make me go 'rah rah'
Make me go 'rah rah'
Make me go 'rah rah'
Till you say 'hello kitty'
Make me go 'rah rah'
