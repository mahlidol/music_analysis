Don't wanna have to pretend to be someone you like
Don't wanna have to defend the way I live my life
I'm sad when you pull away, I see that you don't care
'Cause you just wanna play games, but you never play fair

'Cause you don't really want my love
Baby it's so obvious
And I know this is gonna be, the last you ever hear from me

So let down and so forgotten
You don't want me in your life
I can see your life is rotten
Now I'm learning how to fly

(Aah) 'Cause I realise
Tried so hard to keep our love alive
(Aah) 'Cause I realise, all I've known is how to say "goodbye"

Goodbye, goodbye

I let my tears run dry, as I swallow my pride
I wanted reality, but you prefer the fantasy (Ooh)

'Cause you don't really want my love
You just wanna fill your cup (Ooh)
Another hobby you give up
And I'm the girl you like to wind up

So let down and so forgotten (Aah)
You don't want me in your life
I can see, your life is rotten (Aah)
Now I'm learning how to fly

(Aah) 'Cause I realise
Tried so hard to keep our love alive
(Aah) 'Cause I realise, all I've known is how to say "goodbye"

Goodbye, goodbye (All you ever told me was "goodbye")
How to say "goodbye"
Goodbye, goodbye

The more I push, the more you pull (Ooh, ooh)
You play the joker, I'll be the fool (Ooh, ooh)

So let down and so forgotten
You don't want me in your life
Best thing that you ever taught me
Showed me how to say goodbye

(Aah) 'Cause I realise
Tried so hard to keep our love alive
(Aah) 'Cause I realise, all I've known is how to say "goodbye"

Goodbye, goodbye (All you ever told me was "goodbye")
How to say "goodbye" (All you ever told me was "goodbye")
Goodbye, goodbye
