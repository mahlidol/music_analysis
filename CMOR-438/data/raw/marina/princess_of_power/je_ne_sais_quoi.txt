In my garden, you're in the sun
Give you a lesson in seduction
It feels different, it feels fun
You make me wanna be someone you love

I don't care what they say, I don't care what they do
'Cause I've never been loved by somebody like you

You've got that je ne sais quoi, je ne sais quoi
I'm falling for you, don't know who you are
Je ne sais quoi, je ne sais quoi
I'm so into you, you're hotter than God

So obsessed yet so undercover
Maybe we're both as bad as each other
Heartbreak is hard but loving is tougher
When cryptic people mirror each other

I don't care what they say, I don't care what they do
'Cause I've never been loved by somebody like you

You've got that je ne sais quoi, je ne sais quoi
I'm falling for you, don't know who you are
Je ne sais quoi, je ne sais quoi
I'm so into you, you're hotter than God

Je ne sais quoi, donc kiss me et voilà
Je ne sais quoi, donc kiss me et voilà

Maybe you're not mysterious, just a little insecure
Acting oh so serious, don't know who you do it for?
Maybe you're not what you seem
You're not the man of my dreams
But I just love the uncertainty

Je ne sais quoi, je ne sais quoi
I'm falling for you, don't know who you are
Je ne sais quoi, je ne sais quoi
I'm so into you, you're hotter than God

You've got that je ne sais quoi, je ne sais quoi
I'm falling for you, don't know who you are
Je ne sais quoi, je ne sais quoi
I'm so into you, you're hotter than God

Je ne sais quoi, donc kiss me et voilà
Je ne sais quoi, donc kiss me et voilà

Je ne sais quoi
Don't break my heart
Je ne sais quoi
Don't break my heart
Don't break my heart
Don't break my heart
Don't break my heart
Don't break my heart
