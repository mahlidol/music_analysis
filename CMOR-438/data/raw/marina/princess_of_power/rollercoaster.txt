I wanna go on a roller-coaster
I wanna do things I'm not supposed to
I wanna go where the free ones live now
Never going back to the place I lived, no

I wanna swim
Topless in the ocean
Have sex on the sand
On the grass, in the garden
Spread me like a picnic on the floor in the forest
'Cause I don't wanna live if I can't be honest

Baby, I've been down, I've been down so low
But the more I love myself, the higher up I wanna go oh
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

I'm on a roller-coaster ride
I've been low, but I know that I wanna get high
I've never been so happy
Smiling so wide
I never thought I'd find the love of my life

I wanna kiss you until I see stars
I wanna see inside of your heart

I wanna swim
Topless in the ocean
Have sex on the sand
On the grass, in the garden
Spread me like a picnic on the floor in the forest
'Cause I don't wanna live if I can't be honest

Baby, I've been down, I've been down so low
But the more I love myself, the higher up I wanna go oh

I'm on a roller-coaster ride
I've been low, but I know that I wanna get high
I've never been so happy
Smiling so wide
I never thought I'd find the love of my life
