I was dreaming something dark,
Hiding body parts.
A broken dog, a broken leg,
I left it cold, I left it dead.

Oh I'm a guilty one,
And know what I have done.
Yeah, I'm a troubled one,
And I won't be forgiven.

Guilty on the run,
And I know what I have done.
Guilty on the run,
And I'm never forgiven.

I was just a kid,
That you could not forgive,
Because it's harder.

I was just a kid,
And all I really wanted,
Was my father.

I killed a dog so smart and rare.
Touched his techni-coloured hair.
I left it bruised and black and lame.
I left it running full of shame.

Oh I'm a guilty one,
And know what I have done.
Yeah, I'm a troubled one,
And I won't be forgiven.

Guilty on the run,
And I know what I have done.
Guilty on the run,
And I'm never forgiven.

I was just a kid,
That you could not forgive,
Because it's harder.

I was just a kid,
And all I really wanted,
Was my father.

Spent years singing to forget, (to forget).
Spent years singing, "no regret".
Then suddenly it all becomes clear,
I've been sorry all these years.

I was just a kid,
That you could not forgive,
Because it's harder.

I was just a kid,
And all I really wanted,
Was my father.

Guilty on the run,
And I know what I have done.
Guilty on the run,
And I'm never forgiven.

Guilty on the run,
And I know what I have done.
Guilty on the run,
And I'm never forgiven.
