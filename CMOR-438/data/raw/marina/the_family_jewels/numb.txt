One track mind like a gold fish
Stuck inside my Petri dish
I can't breathe and I can't smile
This better be worth my while

I feel numb most of the time
The lower I get the higher I'll climb
And I will wonder why
I got dark only to shine
Looking for the golden light
Oh, it's a reasonable sacrifice
Burn, burn, burn bright

Forego families, forego friends
It's how it started, how it ends
I can't open up and cry
'Cause I've been silent all my life

I feel numb most of the time
The lower I get the higher I'll climb
And I will wonder why
I got dark only to shine
Looking for the golden light
Oh it's a reasonable sacrifice
Burn, burn, burn bright
Burn, burn, burn bright

Oh, I get dark oh and I'm in hell
I need a friend, oh but I can't yell
Yeah, I'm no good, no good to anyone
'Cause all I care about is being number one

Shine, looking for the golden light
Oh it's a reasonable sacrifice

Shine, looking for the golden light
Oh it's a reasonable sacrifice (sacrifice)

I feel numb most of the time
The lower I get the higher I'll climb
And I will wonder why
I got dark only to shine

And I'll light up the sky
Stars that burn the brightest
Fall so fast and pass you by
Cough like empty lighters

I feel numb most of the time
The lower I get the higher I'll climb
And I will wonder why
I get dark only to shine

And I'll light up the sky
Stars that burn the brightest
Fall so fast and pass you by
Spark like empty lighters
