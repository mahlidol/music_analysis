Lay dagger dead inside a lonely bed
Trying to hide the hole inside my head
Watching the stars slide down to reach the end
The sleep is not my friend

Drinking champagne to forget yesterday
Coz I remember, the way, the way, the way
It ended the day, the day, the day, the day
That I walked away, away, away, away

Drinking champagne, made by the angel
Who goes by the name of Glittering Gabriel
Drinking champagne made of an angel's
Tears and pain, but I feel celestial

Elderly stars slide down the morning sky
Slipping away to find a place to die
I wonder when the night will reach its end
The sleep is not my friend

Drinking champagne, meant for a wedding
Toast to the bride, a fairytale ending
Drinking champagne, a bottle to myself
Savor the taste of fabricated wealth

Drinking champagne, made by the angel
Who goes by the name of Glittering Gabriel
Drinking champagne made of an angel's
Tears and pain, but I feel celestial

Celestial
Celestial
Celestial
Celestial

Drinking champagne, made by the angel
Who goes by the name of Glittering Gabriel
Drinking champagne made of an angel's
Tears and pain, but I feel celestial

Drinking champagne, made by the angel
Who goes by the name of Glittering Gabriel
Drinking champagne made of an angel's
Tears and pain, but I feel celestial
