Gonna make you mine forever
Never let you leave my sight
You can run, you can hide
But girl, I'm gonna make you mine

It's just forever
It's just forever

I'll never stop until you love me
Even if you treat me cold
I'll love you 'til we decompose
And the skin falls off our bones

It's just forever
It's just forever
It's just forever
It's just forever

Forever (Ahhh)
Forever (Ahhh)
Forever (Ahhh)
(Ahhh)

Maybe we can die together
Laying side by side
Even in the afterlife
Girl, you'll still be mine

It's just forever
It's just forever

Promise that you'll never leave me
Promise that you'll follow and lead me
Breathe me all in, taste of my skin
Give me your heart like a hole in the head

Forever (Ahhh)
Forever (Ahhh)
Forever (Ahhh)
Forever
Forever
Forever (Ahhh!)
