[Eliza:]
Alexander, come back to sleep

[Hamilton:]
I have an early meeting out of town

[Eliza:]
It's still dark outside

[Hamilton:]
I know. I just need to write something down

[Eliza:]
Why do you write like you're running out of time?

[Hamilton:]
Shhh

[Eliza:]
Come back to bed. That would be enough

[Hamilton:]
I'll be back before you know I'm gone

[Eliza:]
Come back to sleep

[Hamilton:]
This meeting's at dawn

[Eliza:]
Well, I'm going back to sleep

[Hamilton:]
Hey. Best of wives and best of women
