[Philip:]
Meet the latest graduate of King's College!
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but, dag, I amaze and astonish!
The scholars say I got the same virtuosity and brains as my pops!
The ladies say my brain's not where the resemblance stops!
I'm only nineteen but my mind is older
Gotta be my own man, like my father, but bolder
I shoulder his legacy with pride
I used to hear him say
That someday I would

[Ensemble:]
Blow us all away

[Philip:]
Ladies, I'm looking for a Mr. George Eacker
Made a speech last week, our Fourth of July speaker
He disparaged my father's legacy in front of a crowd
I can't have that, I'm making my father proud

[Martha:]
I saw him just up Broadway a couple of blocks
He was goin' to see a play

[Philip:]
Well, I'll go visit his box

[Dolly:]
God, you're a fox

[Philip:]
And y'all look pretty good in ya' frocks
How 'bout when I get back, we all strip down to our socks?

[Both:]
OK!

[Company:]
Blow us all away!

[Philip:]
George!

[George:]
Shh

[Philip:]
George!

[George:]
Shh! I'm tryin' to watch the show!

[Philip:]
Ya' shoulda watched your mouth before you talked about my father though!

[George:]
I didn't say anything that wasn't true
Your father's a scoundrel, and so, it seems, are you

[Ensemble:]
Ooooooooooh!

[Philip:]
It's like that?

[George:]
Yeah, I don't fool around
I'm not your little schoolboy friends

[Philip:]
See you on the dueling ground
That is, unless you wanna step outside and go now

[George:]
I know where to find you, piss off
I'm watchin' this show now

Shh

[Philip:]
Pops, if you had only heard the shit he said about you
I doubt you would have let it slide and I was not about to

[Hamilton:]
Slow down

[Philip:]
I came to ask you for advice
This is my very first duel
They don't exactly cover this subject in boarding school

[Hamilton:]
Did your friends attempt to negotiate a peace?

[Philip:]
He refused to apologize, we had to let the peace talks cease

[Hamilton:]
Where is this happening?

[Philip:]
Across the river, in Jersey

[Hamilton/Philip:]
Everything is legal in New Jersey…

[Hamilton:]
Alright
So this is what you're gonna do:
Stand there like a man until Eacker is in front of you
When the time comes, fire your weapon in the air
This will put an end to the whole affair

[Philip:]
But what if he decides to shoot?
Then I'm a goner

[Hamilton:]
No, he'll follow suit if he's truly a man of honor
To take someone's life, that is something you can't shake
Philip, your mother can't take another heartbreak

[Philip:]
Father

[Hamilton:]
Promise me
You don't want this
Young man's blood on your conscience

[Philip:]
Okay, I promise

[Hamilton:]
Come back home when you're done
Take my guns, be smart
Make me proud, son

[Philip:]
My name is Philip
I am a poet
And I'm a little nervous, but I can't show it
I'm sorry, I'm a Hamilton with pride
You talk about my father, I cannot let it slide
Mister Eacker! How was the rest of your show?

[George:]
I'd rather skip the pleasantries
Let's go
Grab your pistol

[Philip:]
Confer with your men
The duel will commence after we count to ten

[Ensemble:]
Count to ten!

[Philip:]
Look 'em in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then slowly and clearly aim your gun towards the sky

[Male Ensemble:]
One two three four

[Full Ensemble:]
Five six seven
