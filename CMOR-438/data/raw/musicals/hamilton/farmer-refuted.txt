[Seabury:]
Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present "Free Thoughts on the Proceedings of the Continental Congress!"

Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart
[Mulligan:]
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart
[Seabury:]
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me
[Burr:]
Let him be
[Seabury:]
They're playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame…

[Hamilton (Seabury):]
Yo!
He'd have you all unravel at the (Heed not the rabble)
Sound of screams but the (Who scream)
Revolution is comin' (Revolution, they)
The have-nots are gonna (Have not your)
Win this (Interests)
It's hard to listen to you with a straight face (At heart)
Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us (Chaos and bloodshed are not a)
Honestly, you shouldn't even talk (Solution)
And what about Boston? Look at the cost, n' all that we've lost n' you talk (Don't let them lead you astray)
About Congress?! (This Congress does not speak for me)
My dog speaks more eloquently than thee!
(They're playing a dangerous game)
But strangely, your mange is the same
(I pray the king shows you his mercy)
Is he in Jersey?
(For shame)
For the revolution!
(For shame!)
[Company:]
For the revolution!

[Seabury:]
Heed
[Hamilton:]
If you repeat yourself again I'm gonna
[Seabury/Hamilton:]
Scream
[Hamilton:]
Honestly, look at me, please don't read!
[Seabury:]
Not your interests
[Hamilton:]
Don't modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?
[Burr:]
Alexander, please!
[Hamilton:]
Burr, I'd rather be divisive than indecisive, drop the niceties

[Ensemble:]
Silence! A message from the King!
A message from the King!
[Full Company:]
A message from the King!
