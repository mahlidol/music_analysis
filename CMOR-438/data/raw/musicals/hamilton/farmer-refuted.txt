Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present "Free Thoughts on the Proceedings of the Continental Congress!"

Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me
Let him be
They're playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame…

Yo!
He'd have you all unravel at the (Heed not the rabble)
Sound of screams but the (Who scream)

The have-nots are gonna (Have not your)
Win this (Interests)
It's hard to listen to you with a straight face (At heart)
Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us (Chaos and bloodshed are not a)

For the revolution!
(For shame!)
For the revolution!

If you repeat yourself again I'm gonna

Scream
Honestly, look at me, please don't read!

Not your interests
Don't modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?

Alexander, please!
Burr, I'd rather be divisive than indecisive, drop the niceties

Silence! A message from the King!
A message from the King!
A message from the King!
