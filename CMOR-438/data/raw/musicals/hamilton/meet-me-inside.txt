[Hamilton:]
Lee, do you yield?

[Burr:]
You shot him in the side!
Yes, he yields!

[Laurens:]
I'm satisfied

[Burr:]
Yo, we gotta clear the field!

[Hamilton:]
Go! We won

[Company:]
Here comes the General!

[Burr:]
This should be fun

[Washington:]
What is the meaning of this? Mr. Burr, get a medic for the General

[Burr:]
Yes, sir

[Washington:]
Lee, you will never agree with me
But believe me, these young men don't speak for me
Thank you for your service

[Burr:]
Let's ride!

[Washington:]
Hamilton!

[Hamilton:]
Sir!

[Washington:]
Meet me inside

[Company:]
Meet him inside! Meet him inside!
Meet him inside, meet him, meet him inside!

[Washington:]
Son

[Hamilton:]
Don't call me son

[Washington:]
This war is hard enough
Without infighting

[Hamilton:]
Lee called you out
We called his bluff

[Washington:]
You solve nothing, you aggravate our allies to the south

[Hamilton:]
You're absolutely right, John should have shot him in the mouth
That would've shut him up

[Washington:]
Son

[Hamilton:]
I'm notcha son

[Washington:]
Watch your tone
I am not a maiden in need of defending, I am grown

[Hamilton (overlapping):]
Charles Lee, Thomas Conway
These men take your name and they rake it through the mud

[Washington:]
My name's been through a lot, I can take it

[Hamilton:]
Well, I don't have your name
I don't have your titles
I don't have your land
But, if you

[Washington:]
No

[Hamilton:]
If you gave me command of a battalion, a group of men to lead, I could fly above my station after the war

[Washington:]
Or you could die and we need you alive

[Hamilton:]
I'm more than willing to die

[Washington:]
Your wife needs you alive, son, I need you alive

[Hamilton:]
Call me son one more time

[Washington:]
Go home, Alexander
That's an order from your commander

[Hamilton:]
Sir

[Washington:]
Go home
