[Philip:]
Look!
Grandpa's in the paper!
"War hero Philip Schuyler loses senate seat to young upstart Aaron Burr"
Grandpa just lost his seat in the senate

[Eliza:]
Sometimes that's how it goes

[Philip:]
Daddy's gonna find out any minute

[Eliza:]
I'm sure he already knows

[Philip:]
Further down

[Philip and Eliza:]
Further down

[Philip:]
Let's meet the newest senator from New York

[Eliza:]
New York

[Philip and Eliza:]
Our senator

[Hamilton:]
Burr?
Since when are you a Democratic-Republican?

[Burr:]
Since being one put me on the up and up again

[Hamilton:]
No one knows who you are or what you do

[Burr:]
They don't need to know me
They don't like you

[Hamilton:]
Excuse me?

[Burr:]
Oh, Wall Street thinks you're great
You'll always be adored by the things you create
But upstate

[Hamilton:]
Wait

[Burr:]
People think you're crooked
Schuyler's seat was up for grabs so I took it

[Hamilton:]
I've always considered you a friend

[Burr:]
I don't see why that has to end

[Hamilton:]
You changed parties to run against my father-in-law

[Burr:]
I changed parties to seize the opportunity I saw
I swear your pride will be the death of us all
Beware, it goeth before the fall
