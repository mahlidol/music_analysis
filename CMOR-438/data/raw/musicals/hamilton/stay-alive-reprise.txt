Stay alive...
Stay alive...

[Hamilton:]
Where's my son?

[Doctor:]
Mr. Hamilton, come in
They brought him in a half an hour ago
He lost a lot of blood on the way over

[Ensemble Women:]
Stay alive...

[Hamilton:]
Is he alive?

[Doctor:]
Yes. But you have to understand
The bullet entered just above his hip and
Lodged in his right arm

[Hamilton:]
Can I see him please?

[Doctor:]
I'm doing ev'rything I can, but the wound was
Already infected when he arrived

[Hamilton:]
Philip

[Philip:]

I did exactly as you said, Pa
I held my head up high

[Hamilton (Philip):]
I know, I know. Shh
I know, I know (High)
Shh. I know you did
Ev'rything just right
(Even before we got to ten)
Shh
(I was aiming for the sky)
I know, I know
I know, I know (I was aiming for the sky)
I know
Save your strength and ([With Ensemble Men:] stay alive…)

[Eliza:]
No!

[Hamilton:]

[Eliza:]
Is he breathing? Is he going to survive this?

[Ensemble Men:]
Stay alive...

[Eliza:]
Who did this, Alexander, did you know?

[Philip:]
Mom, I'm so sorry for forgetting what you taught me

[Eliza:]
My son

[Philip:]
We played piano

[Eliza:]
I taught you piano

[Philip:]
You would put your hands on mine

[Eliza:]
You changed the melody every time

[Philip:]
Ha, I would always change the line

[Eliza:]
Shh. I know, I know

[Philip:]
I would always change the line

[Eliza:]
I know, I know
