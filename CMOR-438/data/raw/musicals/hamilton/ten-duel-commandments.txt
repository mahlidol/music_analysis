[Men:]
One, two, three, four

[Full Company:]
Five, six, seven, eight, nine…

[Burr/Hamilton/Laurens/Lee:]
It's the Ten Duel Commandments

[Full Company:]
It's the Ten Duel Commandments
Number one!

[Laurens:]
The challenge: demand satisfaction
If they apologize, no need for further action

[Company:]
Number two!

[Laurens:]
If they don't, grab a friend, that's your second

[Hamilton:]
Your lieutenant when there's reckoning to be reckoned

[Company:]
Number three!

[Lee:]
Have your seconds meet face to face

[Burr:]
Negotiate a peace…

[Hamilton:]
Or negotiate a time and place

[Burr:]
This is commonplace, 'specially 'tween recruits

[Company:]
Most disputes die, and no one shoots
Number four!

[Laurens:]
If they don't reach a peace, that's alright
Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site

[Hamilton:]
You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility

[Burr:]
You have him turn around so he can have deniability

[Company:]
Five!

[Lee:]
Duel before the sun is in the sky

[Company:]
Pick a place to die where it's high and dry
Number six!

[Hamilton:]
Leave a note for your next of kin
Tell 'em where you been. Pray that hell or heaven lets you in

[Company:]
Seven!

[Lee:]
Confess your sins. Ready for the moment
Of adrenaline when you finally face your opponent

[Company:]
Number eight!

[Laurens/Lee/Hamilton/Burr:]
Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight…

[Burr:]
Alexander

[Hamilton:]
Aaron Burr, sir

[Burr:]
Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature?

[Hamilton:]
Sure
But your man has to answer for his words, Burr

[Burr:]
With his life? We both know that's absurd, sir

[Hamilton:]
Hang on, how many men died because Lee was inexperienced and ruinous?

[Burr:]
Okay, so we're doin' this

[Company:]
Number nine!

[Hamilton:]
Look 'em in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then count

[Men:]
One two three four

[Full Company:]
Five six seven eight nine

[Hamilton/Burr:]
Number

[Company:]
Ten paces!

[Hamilton/Burr:]
Fire!
