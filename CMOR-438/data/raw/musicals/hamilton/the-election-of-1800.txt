[Full company:]
The election of 1800

[Jefferson:]
Can we get back to politics?

[Madison:]
Please?

[Jefferson:]
Yo. Ev'ry action has its equal, opposite reaction
John Adams shat the bed. I love the guy, but he's in traction
Poor Alexander Hamilton? He is missing in action
So now I'm facing

[Jefferson and Madison:]
Aaron Burr!

[Jefferson:]
With his own faction

[Madison:]
He's very attractive in the North
New Yorkers like his chances

[Jefferson:]
He's not very forthcoming on any particular stances

[Madison:]
Ask him a question: it glances off, he obfuscates, he dances

[Jefferson:]
And they say I'm a Francophile: at least they know I know where France is!

[Madison:]
Thomas that's the problem, see, they see Burr as a less extreme you

[Jefferson:]
Ha!

[Madison:]
You need to change course, a key endorsement might redeem you

[Jefferson:]
Who did you have in mind?

[Madison:]
Don't laugh

[Jefferson:]
Who is it?

[Madison:]
You used to work on the same staff

[Jefferson:]
Whaaaat

[Madison:]
It might be nice, it might be nice
To get Hamilton on your side

[Jefferson and Madison:]
It might be nice, it might be nice
To get Hamilton on your side

[Burr (Ensemble):]
Talk less!
(Burr!)
Smile more!
(Burr!)
Don't let 'em know what you're against or what you're for!
(Burr!)
Shake hands with him!
(Burr!)
Charm her!
(Burr!)
It's eighteen hundred, ladies, tell your husbands: vote for
Burr! (Burr!)

[Male voter:]
I don't like Adams

[Female voter:]
Well, he's gonna lose, that's just defeatist

[Another male voter:]
And Jefferson

[Two men:]
In love with France!

[Another female voter:]
Yeah, he's so elitist!

[Two women:]
I like that Aaron Burr!

[A woman:]
I can't believe we're here with him!

[A man:]
He seems approachable…?

[Another male voter:]
Like you could grab a beer with him!

[Ensemble:]
Dear Mr. Hamilton: your fellow Fed'ralists would like to know how you'll be voting

[Hamilton:]
It's quiet uptown

[Ensemble:]
Dear Mr. Hamilton: John Adams doesn't stand a chance, so who are you promoting?

[Hamilton:]
It's quiet uptown

[Men (women):]
Jefferson or Burr?
(Jefferson or Burr?)
We know it's lose-lose (We know it's lose-lose)
Jefferson or Burr?
(Jefferson or Burr?)
But if you had to choose (But if you had to choose)

[Even more voters (men and women):]
Dear Mr. Hamilton: (Jefferson or Burr?)
John Adams doesn't stand a chance (We know it's lose-lose)
So who are you promoting? (Jefferson or Burr?)
But if you had to choose (But if you had to choose)

[Hamilton:]
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr. Sir!

[Burr:]
Alexander!

[Hamilton:]
You've created quite a stir, sir!

[Burr:]
I'm going door to door!

[Hamilton:]
You're openly campaigning?

[Burr:]
Sure!

[Hamilton:]
That's new

[Burr:]
Honestly, it's kind of draining

[Hamilton:]
Burr

[Burr:]
Sir!

[Hamilton:]
Is there anything you wouldn't do?

[Burr:]
No, I'm chasing what I want
And you know what?

[Hamilton:]
What?

[Burr:]
I learned that from you

[Ensemble:]
If you had to choose
If you had to choose

[Madison:]
It's a tie!

[Ensemble:]
If you had to choose
If you had to choose

[Jefferson:]
It's up to the delegates!

[Ensemble:]
If you had to choose
If you had to choose

[Jefferson/Madison:]
It's up to Hamilton!

[Voters (Madison/Ensemble):]
If you had to choose
If you had to choose (Jefferson or Burr?)
If you had to (Jefferson or Burr?)
Choose (Choose)
Choose (Choose)
Choose (Choose)

[Hamilton:]
Yo

[Ensemble:]
Oh!

[Hamilton:]
The people are asking to hear my voice

[Ensemble:]
Oh!

[Hamilton:]
For the country is facing a difficult choice

[Ensemble:]
Oh!

[Hamilton:]
And if you were to ask me who I'd promote

[Ensemble:]
Oh!

[Hamilton:]
Jefferson has my vote

[Jefferson/Madison/Ensemble:]
Oh!

[Hamilton:]
I have never agreed with Jefferson once

[Jefferson/Madison/Ensemble:]
Oh!

[Hamilton:]
We have fought on like seventy-five diff'rent fronts

[Jefferson/Madison/Ensemble:]
Oh!

[Hamilton:]
But when all is said and all is done
Jefferson has beliefs, Burr has none

[Ensemble:]
Oooooooooooooh

[Madison and Jefferson:]
Well, I'll be damned
Well, I'll be damned

[Madison:]
Hamilton's on your side

[Ensemble:]
Well, I'll be damned
Well, I'll be damned

[Jefferson:]
And?

[Madison:]
You won in a landslide

[Burr:]
Congrats on a race well-run
I did give you a fight

[Jefferson:]
Uh-huh

[Burr:]
I look forward to our partnership

[Jefferson:]
Our partnership?

[Burr:]
As your vice-President

[Jefferson:]
Ha. Yeah, right
You hear this guy? Man openly campaigns against me, talkin' bout, "I look forward to our partnership."

[Madison:]
It's crazy that the guy who comes in second gets to be Vice President

[Jefferson:]
Yeah, you know what? We can change that. You know why?

[Madison:]
Why?

[Jefferson:]
'Cause I'm the President
Burr, when you see Hamilton, thank him for the endorsement
