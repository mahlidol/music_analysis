And he wrote it down right there

The charge against me
Is a connection with one
([With James:] James Reynolds!)
For purposes of
Improper speculation
([With Burr:] My real crime is an amorous connection with his wife)
For a considerable time
With his knowing consent

[Madison/Burr/Jefferson:]
Damn!

Most of them at my own house."

Someone who understands what I'm struggling here to do

[Angelica:]
I'm not here for you

[Ensemble:]
Oooooh!

[Angelica:]
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
I love my sister more than anything in this life
I will choose her happiness over mine every time
Put what we had aside
I'm standing at her side
You could never be satisfied
God, I hope you're satisfied
