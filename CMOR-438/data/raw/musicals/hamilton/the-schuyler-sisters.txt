[Burr:]
There's nothing rich folks love more
Than going downtown and slummin' it with the poor
They pull up in their carriages and gawk
At the students in the common
Just to watch them talk
Take Philip Schuyler: the man is loaded
Uh-oh, but little does he know that
His daughters, Peggy, Angelica, Eliza
Sneak into the city just to watch all the guys at

[Company:]
Work, work!
[Angelica:]
Angelica!
[Company:]
Work, work!
[Eliza:]
Eliza!
[Peggy:]
And Peggy!
[Company:]
Work, work!

[Angelica:]

[Peggy:]
Daddy said to be home by sundown
[Angelica:]
Daddy doesn't need to know
[Peggy:]
Daddy said not to go downtown
[Eliza:]
Like I said, you're free to go
[Angelica:]
But look around, look around
The revolution's happening in New York
[Eliza/Peggy:]
New York
[Company:]
Angelica
[Schuyler Sisters and company:]
Work!

[Peggy:]
It's bad enough daddy wants to go to war
[Eliza:]
People shouting in the square
[Peggy:]
It's bad enough there'll be violence on our shore
[Angelica:]
New ideas in the air
[Angelica and Male Ensemble:]
Look around, look around
[Eliza:]
Angelica, remind me what we're looking for…
[All men:]
She's lookin' for me!

[Angelica (Company):]
Eliza, I'm lookin' for a mind at work (Work, work!)
I'm lookin' for a mind at work! (Work, work!)
I'm lookin' for a mind at work! (Work, work!)
Whooaaaaa!

[Eliza/Angelica/Peggy:]
Whooaaaaa!
Work!

[Burr:]
Wooh! There's nothin' like summer in the city
Someone in a rush next to someone lookin' pretty
Excuse me, miss, I know it's not funny
But your perfume smells like your daddy's got money
Why you slummin' in the city in your fancy heels
You searching for an urchin who can give you ideals?
[Angelica:]
Burr, you disgust me
[Burr:]
Ah, so you've discussed me
I'm a trust fund, baby, you can trust me!

[Angelica:]
I've been reading Common Sense by Thomas Paine
So men say that I'm intense or I'm insane
You want a revolution? I want a revelation
So listen to my declaration:
[Eliza/Angelica/Peggy:]
"We hold these truths to be self-evident
That all men are created equal"
[Angelica:]
And when I meet Thomas Jefferson
[Company:]
Unh!
[Angelica:]
I'mma compel him to include women in the sequel!
[Women:]
Work!

[Eliza:]
Look around, look around at how
Lucky we are to be alive right now!
[Eliza/Peggy:]
Look around, look around at how
Lucky we are to be alive right now!
[Eliza/Angelica/Peggy:]
History is happening in Manhattan and we just happen to be
In the greatest city in the world!
[Schuyler Sisters and Company:]
In the greatest city in the world!

[Angelica (Eliza/Peggy) {men}:]
'Cause I've been reading Common Sense by Thomas Paine (Look around, look around) {Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!}
So men say that I'm intense or I'm insane (The revolution's happening in) {Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!}
[Angelica (Eliza/Peggy) {women}:]
You want a revolution? I want a revelation (New York! In New York!) {Look around, look around the revolution's happening}
So listen to my declaration:
