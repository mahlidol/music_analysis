[Laurens:]
I may not live to see our glory!

[Mulligan/Lafayette:]
I may not live to see our glory!

[Laurens:]
But I've seen wonders great and small

[Mulligan/Lafayette:]
I've seen wonders great and small

[Laurens:]
'Cause if the tomcat can get married

[Mulligan/Lafayette:]
If Alexander can get married

[Laurens:]
There's hope for our ass, after all!

[Lafayette:]
Raise a glass to freedom

[Laurens/Mulligan:]
Hey!
Something you will never see again!

[Mulligan:]
No matter what she tells you

[Lafayette:]
Let's have another round tonight!

[Laurens:]
Raise a glass to the four of us!

[Lafayette/Hamilton:]
Ho!

[Mulligan:]
To the newly not poor of us!

[Laurens/Lafayette/Hamilton:]
Woo!

[Lafayette:]
We'll tell the story of tonight

[Laurens:]
Let's have another round

[Hamilton:]
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr

[Burr:]
Sir!

[Hamilton:]
I didn't think that you would make it

[Burr:]
To be sure

[Mulligan/Lafayette:]
Burr!

[Burr:]
I came to say congratulations

[Mulligan:]
Spit a verse, Burr!

[Burr:]
I see the whole gang is here

[Lafayette:]
You are the worst, Burr!

[Hamilton:]
Ignore them
Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel
I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal

[Burr:]
No, you don't

[Hamilton:]
Yes, I do

[Burr:]
Now, be sensible
From what I hear, you've made yourself indispensable

[Laurens:]
Well, well, I heard
You've got a special someone on your side, Burr

[Hamilton:]
Is that so?

[Laurens:]
What are you tryin' to hide, Burr?

[Burr:]
I should go

[Hamilton:]
No, these guys should go

[Lafayette:]
What?

[Laurens:]
No!

[Hamilton:]
Leave us alone

[Mulligan:]
Man…

[Hamilton:]
It's alright, Burr
I wish you'd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr

[Burr:]
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir

[Hamilton:]
What do you mean?

[Burr:]
She's married

[Hamilton:]
I see

[Burr:]
She's married to a British officer

[Hamilton:]
Oh shit…

[Burr:]
Congrats again, Alexander
Smile more
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[Hamilton:]
I will never understand you
If you love this woman, go get her!
What are you waiting for?

[Burr:]
I'll see you on the other side of the war

[Hamilton:]
I'll see you on the other side of the war
