Theodosia writes me a letter every day
I'm keeping her bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it

[Burr:]
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher
([Men:] Preacher, preacher, preacher)
But there are things that the
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya
([Men:] Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya)
My mother was a genius
([Women:] Genius)
My father commanded respect
([Men:] Respect, respect)
When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

[Burr/Ensemble:]
Death doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When everyone who loves me has died
I'm willing to wait for it (wait for it)
I'm willing to wait for it

Wait for it
[Ensemble:]
Wait for it
Wait for it

[Burr:]
I am the one thing in life I can control

Wait for it
[Burr:]
I'm not standing still
I am lying in wait
[Ensemble:]
Wait

Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb
[Ensemble:]
Climb
Climb
Climb
[Burr:]
He has something to prove
He has nothing to lose
[Ensemble:]
Lose
Lose
Lose
Lose
[Burr:]
Hamilton's pace is relentless
He wastes no time
[Ensemble:]
Time
Time
Time
[Burr:]
What is it like in his shoes?

Hamilton doesn't hesitate
He exhibits no restraint
He takes and he takes and he takes
And he keeps winning anyway
He changes the game
He plays and he raises the stakes
And if there's a reason
He seems to thrive when so few survive, then Goddamnit

[Burr and Company:]
I'm willing to wait for it (wait for it, wait for...)
I'm willing to wait for it...

Life doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall and we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many have died
Then I'm willin' to
