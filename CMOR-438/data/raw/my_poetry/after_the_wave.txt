i hate that i still see you
 in the features of others
 brown leather jacket,
 flannel ascot cap,
 light brown hair falling
 just right 
 across a stranger’s face.
 my restless heart rises.
 drops again
 just as fast.

some days i miss your voice
 your accented English,
 those strange but perfect synonyms
 that somehow felt
 more like you 
 than any other way.

 the last time i saw you,
 you noticed my hair.
 “you colored it,” you said.
  
some days i miss your smile
 at once a slight frown 
 tucked into the corners
 of your lips.
 your pauses mid-sentence
 searching for the right word 
 in English 
 the joy i felt
 when i guessed it right.

your absence is palpable.
 i’m both grateful 
 and resentful.
 still a child at heart,
 unsure of what i want.
 but deep down, 
 neither are you.

 in retrospect, 
 you were an unexpected wave
 inevitably submerging, 
 momentarily 
 suffocating.

let my final memory 
 be your bandana.
 still on my desk,
 unworn,
 carrying the ghost 
 of your scent
 comforting, unnamable,
 familiar from the start.

if this is how it ends,
 don’t expect it back.
 let me believe,
 in the end,
 i took something 
 from you, too.
