now it's just me 
and the night-shift receptionist
breathing silence 
in the lobby

today i bought
a scarf that looks
kinda like yours but
orange and prettier
untainted
for now at least
by my love

i wear it wondering
whether you still 
wear yours
or if you've
replaced it
discarded it
avoided it
with everything else
that reminds you
of me

too bad you can't
escape the moon 
though i bet
you might want to
if you ever learn
what i tell her 
about you

she tracks you like
an omnipresent eye
sidekick to
the sun

everything i want 
to say to you
i say to her 
instead
so that she
might see you
the way i do
and illuminate 
all your nights
with the quiet love
i never knew how to give
