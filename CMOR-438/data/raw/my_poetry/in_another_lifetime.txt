some moments have this quality 
you know you’ll never forget them.
you roll them around your mind,
inspect each glint,
hungry for what you 
can no longer have.
as if engraving it deep enough
might bring you back again
that bittersweet goodbye
painful, yes, but alive.

i never know
when it’s truly over
when your bus stop came
i couldn’t believe it.
now i play with words like marbles
while you drink and joke with your friends 
who i never want to see again.

i wish you’d never
looked at me like
you’d never met someone like me before
when your eyes would crinkle
across the pub table
with your frown of a smile.
i could never tell
the difference between
amused awe
and simmering contempt.

i’ll learn to live without
your Camel-scented lies
your eyes that would linger
after a beer 
or two
i tasted you twice and
i think that you’re
sweet as honey
harsh as whiskey
or maybe i
tell myself that
so my scars will have 
been worth it

(we both know they
could never be)
