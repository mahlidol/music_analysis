i. your red scarf
that i once scrubbed with soap
in my Istanbul apartment sink
so it would be clean and soft
when i returned it to you

i’d wrung one end in my hands
not expecting the dye to leave.
how cruel is it that care
can be more destructive than use?

i hope you wear it proudly —
my attempts at affection
not like the damning noose
that smiles in your reflection


ii. a red bracelet
bought at a pit stop shop
on the way to Cappadocia
they were all cheap and beautiful
i just couldn’t choose
it wasn’t about what
i had to gain — but
all i still had
to lose

you said i should get
a wine-red one
which i’d also considered
but not particularly
i told myself
not to give in
then watched myself
pay fifty liras for it
say thank you
and leave


iii. my red mug
from Cappadocia —
the one i filled with wine at the beach
the one that got
accidentally seasoned with sand
and a drowned fly

you took a small sip like a dare
but for once
i didn’t meet you there

how does it feel
to mar your pride for someone
who’s finally tired
of free-falling for you?


iv. our red flags
i wonder whose were worse:
you — a boy in denial
to me, maybe, but
to yourself most of all
(a nicer way to say
you were a liar)

me — a girl in a glass house
looking for love behind
locked wooden doors
that bend but never break

i kept you knocking
or maybe it was just me
hearing echoes in the halls
where our silhouettes used to be
(the house is empty but
i saved you a seat)

because my mind
can be a shell —
devoid of love but still
eternally writhing
with need
