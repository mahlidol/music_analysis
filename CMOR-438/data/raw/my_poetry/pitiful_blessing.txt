i’m sorry to her, but
i'll never be to you

most likely you'll
never be painted 
/ preserved
like this again

tell me now
should i pity you for it?

sometimes i catch glimpses
of a future where i'm stronger
still around

i already suspect
you will live on in my art but
i think i might've killed you 
long ago

i read something once
in a book i can't recall
maggie nelson's, maybe
how she never learned
how to stop loving someone

i think i have 
the same ailment
nights like this i wonder
will it ever feel like anything
but a curse?

i imagine your days pass
unsatisfied
drinking with friends 
depthless smiling faces 
blurring into one 

no one asks mona lisa
what her favorite colour is
not only because 
she’s dead
but because maybe
such things never mattered
in the end
