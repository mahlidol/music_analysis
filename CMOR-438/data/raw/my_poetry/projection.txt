there are things i only think about
under the right conditions
meticulous chemical cocktails, like
a never-ending cognitive experiment

i've lingered here for far too long 
you've loitered around long enough

in my mind's master bedroom
i can't tell if i've 
locked you inside
or if i'm the prisoner 
waiting for your knock so that
i won't have to step out alone

i'm not sure how to tell you
i need you more than i want you

but anyway
i’ve kept the door unlocked
hoping that one day 
you'll finally walk through 

i'm being a fool again
asking a dog to fucking fly
yet it still fucking hurts when you 
aren't who you never claimed to be
