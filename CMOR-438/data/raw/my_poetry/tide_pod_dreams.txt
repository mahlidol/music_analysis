the sky was how it will never be again.
to you i claimed it as mine 
but last night i caught myself
still calling it yours.

when the one i’d told you i loved 
for the past three years
finally kissed me 
again
i wanted to pull back —
to tell them about your bandana
sitting folded 
next to us in bed
like an uninvited guest

& about 
the first time i saw it 
tied around your neck,
hiding broken blood vessels
we hadn’t noticed until morning.

months and continents away
when i washed it for the first time
i took it out the dryer 
and laughed.

do you know
what i have to do
to stop mourning something
that was never more
than a bittersweet attachment
a record i both love and hate
skipping, 
replaying
skipping,
skipping,
corrupting in my head

p.s. 
your bandana is still
in my bed
but now it smells
like me
