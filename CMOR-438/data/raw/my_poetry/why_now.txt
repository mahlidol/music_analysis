how can you say i've "reopened" a wound 
when mine never got to close?

don't claim you told her everything when
we both know that’s a lie
she said she’s always wondered
what you’ve been trying to hide

you'll never know the extent to which
i've erased you from your image

believe me when i tell you this: 
i've loved way better
liars than you

i spoke the truth for clarity’s sake, so
i won't explain myself now
to someone who’s only ever cared
for houses built on truths unshared
