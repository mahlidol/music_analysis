Flirting with suspicion
Staring through the glass
Another false transaction
A production of the past
I was lost in fabrication
The finish line was fixed
The code was falling fast
And it was stacking up like bricks

I may never see you again
It's a ball and chain
With the golden handcuffs
You can carry me away
If I say my bad, you can trust in that
Only one holds the keys
To the ball and chain

Cut that ball and chain
Cut that ball and chain
Cut that ball and chain

Lost sense of direction
Just a shadow in the haze
My parasitic past life
Halfway in a daze
I saw that in a distance
That portrait of the past
Etched within an echo
The first will be the last

I may never see you again
It's a ball and chain
With the golden handcuffs
You can carry me away
If I say my bad, you can trust in that
Only one holds the keys
To the ball and chain

Cut that ball and chain
Cut that ball and chain
Cut that ball and chain

I may never see you again
It's a ball and chain
With the golden handcuffs
You can carry me away
If I say my bad, you can trust in that
Only one holds the keys
To the ball and chain
