I'm the bright lights, I'm the feature
I'm a space head, I'm a creature
I'm a lover, I'm a fable
I'm the glutton at your table
Tap dancing, dancing in the tapestry
Last standing, gasping for relief
A fracture in the fantasy
Space elevator, serendipity
Once more, repeat it back to me
My answer to the apathy
Up front, back to the balcony
Get lit

Everybody had a good time, everybody had a good time
Everybody had a good time, better yet, I'm getting mine
Everybody had a good laugh, laughed until we cried
Everybody had a good time, everybody had a good

Whatever you need from me, my heart to hold
My hands, my feet, my tongue, my cheek
My teeth, my more and more and more and more wants more and more
On unbelief, my trust, my lust, transparently
Here in what you see, not only speech
Too shy to share my tears in dreams
I scream
Get lit

Everybody had a good time, everybody had a good time
Everybody had a good time, better yet, I'm getting mine
Everybody had a good laugh, laughed until we cried
Everybody had a good time, everybody had a good

In the morning, we wake up
Woke up, and the sun's still shining
Feeling fuzzy and shook up
Woke up, and we're still alive

Everybody had a good time, everybody had a good time
Everybody had a good time, better yet, I'm getting mine
Everybody had a good laugh, laughed until we cried
Everybody had a good time, everybody had a good
