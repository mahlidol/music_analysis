Metaverse fallout
There's really no rush now
Just in case you want to spell it out
Build me up, then cut me down

It's a natural progression
No need for affection
Just a perfect deflection
When you've got no perspective

Every day spent far from my family
Double check, checked out, I'm half asleep
What the hell? Oh, well, that's life
What the hell? I keep running and running

Living in the passed down
Underneath the dark cloud
The spell you pull me under
Try to steal my thunder

It's a natural progression
No need for affection
Just a perfect deflection
When you've got no perspective

Every day spent far from my family
Double check, checked out, I'm half asleep
What the hell? Oh, well, that's life
What the hell? I keep running and running
Every day, that dream comes back to me
Falling out further, far from my family
What the hell? Oh, well, that's life
What the hell? I keep running and running

Every day spent far from my family
Double check, checked out, I'm half asleep
What the hell? Oh well, that's life
What the hell? I keep running and running
Every day, that dream comes back to me
Falling out further, far from my family
What the hell? Oh, well, that's life
What the hell? I keep running and running
