It takes one to know one
Back at it again
Birds of a feather
Until the end
Stitched, patched up and sewed in
I'll probably see you again
Most certain it's likely
Around, no doubt, my friend

It's a hit and run, oh no
Double-crossed by a neon pill
Like a loaded gun, my love
Double-crossed, crossed by a neon pill

The taste of your lip balm
Blew me away
Cherry pie ChapStick
Just like back in the day
I sail the Atlantic
Bisou fatal le femme
Mon chéri, exactement
Knocked down, not out, let's roll

It's a hit and run, oh no
Double-crossed by a neon pill
Like a loaded gun, my love
I lost control of the wheel
Double-crossed by a neon pill

Out in the open, I'm thinking it through
And it took so long to find you, to find you

It's a hit and run, oh no
Double-crossed by a neon pill
Like a loaded gun, my love
Double-crossed
It's a hit and run, oh no
Double-crossed by a neon pill
Like a loaded gun, my love
I lost (I lost) control (Control) of the wheel (Of the wheel)
Double-crossed by a neon pill
Double-crossed by a neon pill
Double-crossed by a neon pill
