With angry wings, I flew out of that town
I promised you I'd never turn around
Cocaine buzz and a caffeine high
Open all the windows under midnight skies
With angry wings, I flew out of that town

Chasing down a dream
Like a shadow in the breeze
From a thousand miles away
Wish you were right in front of me

Man, I really messed up now
Too afraid to say it out loud
I can barely breathe, who'm I tryin' to be?
I'm still tryin' to figure it out
Man, I really messed up now

Clipped those wings and I came back home
Tried my best just to carry on
Stick-and-poke tattoos meant nothin' to me
As far as east to west and not a memory
Mm, mm

Man, I really messed up now
Too afraid to say it out loud
I can barely breathe, who'm I tryin' to be?
I'm still tryin' to figure it out
Am I too proud to say it out loud?

Chasing down a dream
Like a shadow in the breeze
From a thousand miles away
Wish you were still in front of me

I don't wanna mess up now
Too afraid to say it out loud
I can barely breathe, who'm I tryin' to be?
I'm still tryin' to figure it out
Man, I really messed up now
