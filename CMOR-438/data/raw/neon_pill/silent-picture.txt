He stood outside the door
At the bottom of the staircase
Trying to put the pieces together
Like a silent film he'd watched a thousand times before
She sank beneath the scene
Silently, she screams
Dried her eyes, and sighed
Lying on the bathroom floor
"I can hardly breathe, I can't breathe, I can't breathe"

I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna know if you're there
I don't wanna think about it
I just want the world to disappear
Take it out on me, turn your back on me
Oh yeah
T-take it out on me, turn your back on me
I don't care

She scrambled for the keys
Bags were packed to leave
No more lies, wasted time
Lying on the bathroom floor
I can hardly breathe, I can't breathe, I can't breathe
I'll just rest in peace, rest in peace
Bury me, bury me

I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna know if you're there
I don't wanna think about it
I just want the world to disappear
Take it out on me, turn your back on me
Oh yeah
T-take it out on me, turn your back on me
I don't care

I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna know if you're there
I don't wanna think about it
I just want the world to disappear
Take it out on me, turn your back on me
Oh yeah
T-take it out on me, turn your back on me
I don't care
