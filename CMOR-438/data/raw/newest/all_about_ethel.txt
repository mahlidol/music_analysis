Ethel Cain hated my Instagram post
Thinks it's cute reenactin' my Chicago pose
Hard to roll in slow motion
Hard to say no to caucaution
Hard to stop when it's like an ocean
Not afraid to say I'm goin' down in flames

The most famous girl at the Waffle House
I don't regret it
The most famous girl at the Waffle House

My best friend's grandfather invented the design
How could I be afraid to hide the shine?
It follows me wherever I go
I'm as famous at a show
As I am on the Florida-Alabama Line

By the way, Jack said don't call him
And take the other Jack's name out your phone
