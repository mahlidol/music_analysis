Little bird, bluebird
Fly away, for both of us
For you have wings
And I've no means to fly
Little bird, bluebird
Find some strength inside my hand
Anything to let you sing, goodbye

For your thoughts are small
They can't keep you from leaving
As the wake of my past crashes in
I hear the door slam
But the windows wide open
We both shouldn't be dealing with him

Find a way to fly
Find a way to fly
Just shoot for the sun
Til I can finally run
Find a way to fly

I've kept him at bay
But the horses are coming
They're racing their way around the bend
Your crash landings over
But the evening is humming
Don't make me say it again

Find a way to fly
Find a way to fly
Just shoot for the sun
Til I can finally run
Find a way to fly

Just shoot for the sun
Til I can finally run
Find a way to fly
