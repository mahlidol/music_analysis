my brain is scrambled and pasted back together 
every day and every night
i don’t know what to make of it
i don’t know what i’m trying to do
my heart is black and my mind is blue
my soul is cold and my hands are too

i didn't let you stay but i hope you know you could have
the choice was always yours, always yours, always yours
i hope we both knew it because the alternative is worse
you couldn't love me then but i loved you, i loved you, i loved you

you know nothing about me and i know nothing about you
i know you want to think you know me well
you don't know who i've become in your wake
a gray perpetual frown has locked into place
smiles are as foreign to me now as your lips
i take your scraps as prophecy and wonder why
there are no answers to be found here

you read the poems i’d written but kept your thoughts to yourself
i hope i invade your mind in a way you’ll never feel again

everyone tells me that you're a bad person
you reduced us to a kiss and she told me about your other
go big or go home, right? 
what the hell is wrong with you?
