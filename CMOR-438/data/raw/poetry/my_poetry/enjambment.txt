i write from a place of grief 
but also reverence for
the version of myself who
jumped out the window and
fractured my ankle and
i think i hated you because i
felt i needed you and i
couldn’t risk hoping that you
would meet me at the
top of the hill 
without having to
admit that maybe i
i needed you there
by my side
all squinty-eyed
from the sun
coughing out
your cotton lungs
before taking
another drag

i imagine your
poor alveoli —
singeing
suffocating
with grime and ash
a poison
you pick
again
and again

for a time i hoped 
you’d choke
on all your sweet omissions
clogging up your throat

do you remember when
you signed your
name on my cast and
you drew a Sharpie cross and
i threw someone’s lighter
out the pub window 
for offering it 
to light your stupid cigarette?

i couldn’t bear to 
look at it
couldn't stand to
look at you
i wish i'd never
looked at you

do you know that i
cut it off too early and 
i have paid the price 
every right step since?

some nights i wonder
how much you hate me
for my mistakes
if it’s nearly as much
as i hate myself
(some nights when
the moon shines
a bit too bright)
for yours

these nights i wish
i'd never glimpsed 
myself in your eyes.
you were a satellite
i was a star
in love with your glint
the way you laughed
at my jokes

for a second there
i forgot that
what i saw 
was just my own
reflection.

i reached out
to touch you
i never thought that
you’d melt in my hands
now you’re liquid metal
i’ll keep you in my core
