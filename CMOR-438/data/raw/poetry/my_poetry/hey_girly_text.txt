hi,

or hello,

or hey girly,

or what?

i wanted to say
it’s been half a year at least but
i’ve been meaning to say
what i didn’t know how to say
how to even start
how i kept his secret like
it wasn’t mine at all

a good friend told me yesterday
he can be sorry, but
that doesn’t mean
it didn’t happen.

she told me to
finally tell you
but in the morning, once
i’d slept on it first
so here i am
telling myself i will tell you
though my mind blanks when
i think of it all

i see your face in insta-sized proportions
pixelized perfection on my phone screen
the only version of you
i’ll ever meet
i know that you’re real but
my body can’t imagine yours
how your presence might feel
entering any room
how much he might’ve
missed it all those months
i can't forget his
ambivalent brown eyes 

maybe all he saw was
the cuts on our arms
i’ll never know if he has
ever carved out his own scars 
is it wrong of me
to envy you for knowing?

my friend is right
if he hasn’t told you
you deserve to know
if he has told you
you deserve an apology
from me as well

i feel insane
for someone who was never mine
don’t worry, love, he
always loved you more
maybe that’s just
how they come and go

if you don't mind though, 
i really want to know:
can i ask you how
it feels to have him stay?

you look fall-in-loveable
i think i mights some nights as well

are you still together?
did you ever suspect?
were his friends from Berlin
your friends, too?
do you pity me the way that i
think i might pity you?

what if i
told you how
we talked about love,
our dating history and
his crazy ex
not once did he
mention you to me
not once did i
ever acknowledge thee

the ghost in the room
you’re what i assumed
you’re definitely pretty but
he thought i was, too

what if i told you that
it was me who convinced him that
a six-month relationship
is actually considered “long”
i think he’d downplayed it
but for my sake or his own,
i still can’t say i know

i looked the other way
every time i saw how
he minimized you
“i miss my dogs more”
when someone asked him
if he ever missed you

i tell you now because
i think i’d want to know
what’s been my secret to keep
is now my truth to speak
my silence would be worse 
than a homewrecker’s letter
slid under your digital door
(when all is said and done
i hope he loved you more)
