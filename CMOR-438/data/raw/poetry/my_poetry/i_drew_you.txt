did your heart jump a bit there,
seeing your faceless depiction?
were you scared for a moment?
what if i said i wanted you to be?

holding my heart has been exhausting lately
i keep writing for reasons unknown to me

a part of me hates you still
but it's calming now, knowing how
people see you through my eyes, so
i'm no longer the only monster

i think i've outsourced my emotions
you never needed to have a face
