my name never sounded right
rolling off your German tongue —
the soft h your throat
turned guttural,
something 
primal
abrasive
unpleasant
clawing its way out

you had to call me three times
for me to recognize my name 
it sounded so foreign, so wrong
coming from you
like the shape of someone who
you tried to trace
blissfully unaware of
just how wrong you were

i told myself
i’d never correct you —
i’d rather be mispronounced
than tasted 
/ adored
abandoned
/ alone
recognized
/ regretted.

but 
these days i 
keep thinking how i
i never corrected you.
i never corrected you.
i never corrected you.

now
some nights i see that i
maybe instead i
i corrected 
myself.
i corrected 
myself.
i corrected 
myself.
