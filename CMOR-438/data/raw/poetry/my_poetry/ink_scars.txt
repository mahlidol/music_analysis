the other day i got a tattoo
one i never showed you
in the city where you lived
stopped by then left again

no i don't regret it now
i still feel it in my soul
liminal is the bed you make
when no roads lead to home

i'd brought a book to the studio:
death by black hole
cosmic fun-facts for the public
never meant to be taken literally

but i took them literally

liminal is the bed we made
not knowing how to stay

everyone needs a witness
even the stars in the sky

i wonder sometimes
just how old they are
whether they still exist
or if these rays 
reaching my retina
are all that's left
of what once burned bright

they travel for eons but
never grow old
only redshift
misinterpreted
poeticized past reason
in my eyes they still shine
the way you always might
