not subliminal,
but liminal.
a state we all inhabit
at one time or another
maybe some more than others,
but a stranger to none
nonetheless.

liminal
like the patience that breathes
between heartbeats,
the stillness that throbs
in questions unanswered
truths unsaid.

liminality.
maybe it aches,
or hums,
or sings to your heart
but it’s there,
our eternal cosmic microwave,
watching the stars
pack up and leave.

life is,
maybe,
a lesson on love,
the liminality of it all.
learning to live with
the passage of time,
a doorway
between who you were
and who you might become.
