Sometimes people gonna let you down
Not everybody's meant to stick around
I feel the pain and you feel it too
But I won't let nobody treat me like you do
I've had enough of being on my own
All these people I don't know
I guess I'll make it on my own

So I'm saying goodbye, goodbye
Watch me grow from afar as I turn into a butterfly
Now I'm leaving you behind, behind

Yeah, I'm a butterfly
You just never see my energy
I'm already high, floating on a breeze
Butterfly, fly high
Yeah, I'm a butterfly
You just never see me spread my wings
I'm already high
Watch my life go "bling, bling"
Now I've become a butterfly, I just fly

No longer a baby, yeah, I've been around
I can see how people like to move in this town
Trust no bitch, even people that you love
I can flip a switch quicker than a blade does

So I'm saying goodbye, goodbye
Watch me shine like a star
Like a star in the sky
Now I'm leaving you behind, behind

Yeah, I'm a butterfly
You just never see my energy
I'm already high, floating on a breeze
Butterfly, fly high
Yeah, I'm a butterfly
You just never see me spread my wings
I'm already high
Watch my life go "bling, bling"
So I've become a butterfly, I just fly

Red, gold, orange, blue
White, green, violet too
Too bad you'll never see
The colours inside me
To become a butterfly
Parts of me had to die
Spread my wings in the golden light
And I fly
And I fly

Yeah, I'm a butterfly
You just never see my energy
I'm already high, floating on a breeze
Butterfly, fly high
Yeah, I'm a butterfly
You just never see me spread my wings
I'm already high
Watch my life go "bling, bling"
Now I've become a butterfly, I just fly

So I fly, I fly, I fly
Into the, the light, the light
I'm gonna fly, gonna fly
Like you've never seen
Thought that you did
But you don't know me
Too bad you'll never see
The colours inside me
Too bad you'll never see
The colours inside me
