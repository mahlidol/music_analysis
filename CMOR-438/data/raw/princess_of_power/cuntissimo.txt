Ah, I'm a star, I'm a star, I'm a star
I'll be shining wherever you are
I'm a star, I'm a star, I'm a star
You're so close to me, but I'm so far
It's the power when I'm walkin'
On the streets, sweet talkin'
Push-up bra in my diamonds
Gift from my ex-husband

(Cuntissimo) Oh baby, it's a way of life
(Cuntissimo) Don't let nobody dull my shine
(Cu-cuntissimo) This ain't no Bonnie and Clyde
(Uh-huh, uh-huh) But you can be my Velma on the side

They say that I should settle down
But I don't wanna (Don't wanna)
I don't wanna (Wanna, wanna)

(Cuntissimo) Salma Hayek in the sun
(Cuntissimo) Louise and Thelma on the run
(Cuntissimo) Your ex is hitting you up (Up)
But you no longer give a fuck
(Cuntissimo) Leaving that loser on read
(Cu-cuntissimo) Don't let him back in your bed
(Cuntissimo) 'Cause your energy is precious (Ah)
Not your fault he fell in love

Ah, yeah, I'm sweet and I'm icy and strange
Indecisive, obsessive, I crave
A glass of ice-cold champagne
Smoke a Vogue out in the rain
Yeah, we go to Lake Como
Then we take over a château
I've been living in a Kaftan
Do people still say YOLO?

(Cuntissimo) Oh baby, it's a way of life
(Cuntissimo) Don't let nobody dull my shine
(Cu-cuntissimo) This ain't no Bonnie and Clyde
(Uh-huh, uh-huh) But you can be my Velma on the side

They say that I should settle down
But I don't wanna
I don't wanna (Wanna, wanna, woo)

(Cuntissimo) Salma Hayek in the sun
(Cuntissimo) Louise and Thelma on the run
(Cuntissimo) Your ex is hitting you up (Up)
But you no longer give a fuck
(Cuntissimo) Leaving that loser on read
(Cu-cuntissimo) Don't let him back in your bed
(Cuntissimo) 'Cause your energy is precious (Ah)
Not your fault he fell in love

I live the American life
So I do it my way, yeah, I do what I like
I live the Italian dream
And it set me free, so let's celebrate tonight

Salma Hayek in the sun (Ah-ah)
Louise and Thelma on the run (Ah-ah)
Your ex is hitting you up (Ah)
But you no longer give a fuck
(Cuntissimo) Leaving that loser on read
(Cuntissimo) Don't let him back in your bed
(Cuntissimo) 'Cause your energy is precious (Ah)
Not your fault he fell in love
