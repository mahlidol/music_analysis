Want a digital fantasy
You don't even want the real me
Say it honestly
You don't want real love

Baby, you just want my light
Maybe you're just a parasite
Say you forgot to reply
Even though I always see you're online, online

You just wanna be inside my world, woo hoo
It would take a lot to be your girl, woo hoo
You just wanna like my photographs, woo hoo
As if I'm ever gonna take you back
You're lazy, lazy

I was so love-struck by you
(Hoo!)

Want a digital fantasy
You don't even want the real me
Say it honestly
You don't want real love
Want a digital fantasy
I would rather reality
Sad 'cause honestly I just want your love

Thought you were a hopeless romantic
Turns out you might be a little selfish
Never knew you, but I'll miss you anyway
Longer than I knew you
It's the modern way, the modern way

I just wanna be inside your world, woo hoo
But it would take a lot to be your girl, woo hoo
Everything I did to calm your fears, woo hoo
And all you ever did was bring me tears
You're crazy, crazy

I was so love-struck by you
(Hoo!)

Want a digital fantasy
You don't even want the real me
Say it honestly
You don't want real love
Want a digital fantasy
I would rather reality
Sad 'cause honestly I just want your love

You're never gonna be
With a girl like me
You went and blew it
You blew it
You're never gonna feel
Anything that's real, real
You know what the truth is

Want a digital fantasy
You don't even want the real me
Say it honestly
You don't want real love
(You don't want real love)
Want a digital fantasy
You don't want a real human being
Sad 'cause honestly I just want your love
(I just want your love)

You don't want real love
(You don't want real love)
