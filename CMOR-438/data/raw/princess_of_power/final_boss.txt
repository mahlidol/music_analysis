Boom boom boom
Boom boom boom
Boom boom boom
Boom boom boom
Boom boom boom

That's a gun and I'm shouting your name
That's my sun shining down on your rain
Look what you done
Got nothing left to say
When I'm done, my mind cannot be changed

Are you in the mood to lose me again?
Are you in the mood to be entertained?
You're the final boss in the video game
Once I'm done you'll never see me again

You're the final boss, I'm your rival
But you can't even look me in the eye, no
Like a samurai, don't care if I live or die
'Cause fuck it, baby, I can't be your fall guy
You're the final boss, I'm your rival
But you can't even look me in the eye, no
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Guess I beat you at your own game

I'm fucking sick of you bullying me
You only did it 'cause I acted so sweet
You don't like anything you can't control
But now that means that you end up on your own

Are you in the mood to lose me again?
Are you in the mood to be entertained?
You're the final boss in the video game
Once I'm done you'll never see me again

You're the final boss, I'm your rival
But you can't even look me in the eye, no
Like a samurai, don't care if I live or die
'Cause fuck it, baby, I can't be your fall guy
You're the final boss, I'm your rival
But you can't even look me in the eye, no
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Guess I beat you at your own game

Now I know all your games
People like you never change
Finish him!
Thank you, Mario
But our princess is in another castle

You're the final boss, I'm your rival
But you can't even look me in the eye, no
Like a samurai, don't care if I live or die
'Cause fuck it, baby, I can't be your fall guy
You're the final boss, I'm your rival
But you can't even look me in the eye, no
I know all your games
People like you never change
If I kill you, life will never be the same
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Guess I beat you at your own game

GAME OVER
