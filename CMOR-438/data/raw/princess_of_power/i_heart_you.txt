They're all going to Y2K
We're going to the '70s
Silver stars upon my face
Leather boots upon my knees
Sorry I'm a little late
I been spinnin' 'round and 'round
Welcome to the golden age
Everything is peachy now

Is it something you like?
La-la-la-la, you like?
Is it something you like?

Is it something you like?
La-la-la-la, you like?
Gonna tell you tonight

'Cause I love you
And I know that you love me too
I want you
And I know that you want me too
I love you
I've been waiting to make you mine
I want to be holding you tonight

Where are all the parties now?
I wanna make my way 'round town
Pink and purple, blue and gold
Glitter catsuits, vintage coats
Get on stage, take a bow
Marry me, let's make a vow
Gin martinis, smokin' Vogues
Let's make a party of our own

Is it something you like?
La-la-la-la, you like?
Is it something you like?

Is it something you like?
La-la-la-la, you like?
Gonna tell you tonight

'Cause I love you
And I know that you love me too
I want you
And I know that you want me too
I love you
I've been waiting to make you mine
I want to be holding you tonight
Tonight, tonight
I want to be holding you tonight
Tonight, tonight
I want to be holding you tonight

They're all going to Y2K
We're going to the '70s
Silver stars upon my face
Leather boots upon my knees
There's nothing to complicate
I can see you're into me
Call it love or call it fate
I wanna feel your body heat

I love you
And I know that you love me too
I want you
And I know that you want me too
I love you
I've been waiting to make you mine
I want to be holding you tonight
Tonight, tonight
I want to be holding you tonight
Tonight, tonight
I want to be holding you tonight
