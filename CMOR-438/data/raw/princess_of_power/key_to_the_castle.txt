Every illusion has been destroyed
Looking for love in the center of a void
Mow it's so easy to identify
But you're never gonna be the given time

This isn't love on a silver screen
You want a woman but you can't play games with me

Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
You'll never get the key to the castle
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Now, you'll never get the key to the castle

We played the king and the queen of hearts
Go get the cavalry before you show your cards
Riding away on your stallion
Make your escape off into the winter sun

It was something mythological
Could've been lovers, yeah we could've had it all

Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
You'll never get the key to the castle
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Now, you'll never get the key to the castle

Don't feel a thing for you, no
I'll let you go and lie, and go
I see what you came for
Now I'll settle, settle the score

Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
You'll never get the key to the castle (Ooh)
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
You'll never get the key to the castle

Na-na-na-na-na-na (Watched you grow)
Na-na-na-na-na-na (But I'll watch you fall)
Na-na-na-na-na-na
You'll never get the key to the castle
Na-na-na-na-na-na (Watched you grow)
Na-na-na-na-na-na (But I'll watch you fall)
Na-na-na-na-na-na
You'll never get the key to the castle
