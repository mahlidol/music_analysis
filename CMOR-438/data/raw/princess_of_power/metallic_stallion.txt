I had a dream that I'd always been yours

My metallic stallion races off
But I'm chasing fast till I get on top
I'm the one he can't break off

I been dreaming of you
I been wishing that it's true
That you were made for me
I been wishing on a star
I been wondering where you are
To keep you close to me

I been waiting for love
For your love so long
But I'm gonna be ready
Gonna sing my song

My metallic stallion races off
But I chase him fast till I get on top
Till his reins come off
'Cause he acts so tough but he likes it soft
Know he's scared of love but all bets are off
I'm the one he can't break off

I feel like I been the fool
I been thinking, "What's the use?"
'Cause you don't feel a thing

No, my baby don't want
No, he don't want love
'Cause he'd rather be alone than have to open up

My metallic stallion races off
But I chase him fast till I get on top
Till his reins come off
'Cause he acts so tough but he likes it soft
Know he's scared of love but all bets are off
I'm the one he can't break off

Ever since I was young love had me confused
And now I realise that I've been a fool
You know that I'd always stay
But you just keep running away
Now I see that you don't
Don't wanna be saved

My metallic stallion races off
But I chase him fast till I get on top
Till his reins come off
'Cause he acts so tough but he likes it soft
Know he's scared of love but all bets are off
I'm the one he can't break off
