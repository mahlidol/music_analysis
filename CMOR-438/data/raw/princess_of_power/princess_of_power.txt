A tale as old as time
A story just like mine
You've been hurt by those who were supposed to treat you right
But love is our design

I confused love with control
Love with manipulation
My past has taken its toll
This spaceship has left the station

I'm gonna change my whole life
I've had a revelation
Just had to leave you behind
I can't be lost in translation

I've been hurt by those who were supposed to treat me right
But love is my design

I lived the sweet and I lived the sour
Been living life locked up in tower
But now I'm blooming like a flower
Welcome to my world! Princess of power
Stuck in a loveless generation
Ready to go through a transformation
I'm gonna glow like a meteor shower
Welcome to my world! Princess of power

Big love
Big aura
Big heart
Big adorer
Big love
Big aura
Big heart
Big adorer

I paint my eyes baby blue
Red stars, they shine in my view
Looking like a super heroine
I taught myself how to love again

I've been hurt by those who were supposed to treat me right
But love is my design

I lived the sweet and I lived the sour
Been living life locked up in tower
But now I'm blooming like a flower
Welcome to my world! Princess of power
Stuck in a loveless generation
Ready to go through a transformation
I'm gonna glow like a meteor shower
Welcome to my world! Princess of power

It's not too late to change the way you love, the way you care
'Cause love is in the giving, not on the receiving end
You see, love don't make you weak
It's a superpower in me
Can't you see?
It set me free

I lived the sweet and I lived the sour
Been living life locked up in tower
But now I'm blooming like a flower
Welcome to my world! Princess of power
Stuck in a loveless generation
Ready to go through a transformation
I'm gonna glow like a meteor shower
Welcome to my world! Princess of power

Big love
Big aura
Big heart
Big adorer
Big love
Big aura
Welcome to my world! Princess of power
