We're in power mode
We're in power mode
No turning back, back to explode
'Cause, baby, we're in power mode

(Hm) I can see you watching me
(Hm) You know I'm out of your reach
(Hm) No, baby, don't speak to me
(Hm) I don't fuck with your energy

La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la

Baby, don't you know that I got that power?
Raining down on you like an April shower
Coming out your mouth, keep it sweet and sour
Burning inside me, an eternal flower
Baby, shut your mouth, put your body on me
You got my attention, but it isn't for keeps
Every woman knows that the world is ours
'Cause everybody knows that sex is power

We're in power mode

(Hm) Think you might be scared of me
(Hm) My atro-femininity
(Hm) Try to make me feel your shame
(Hm) Now the bird has fooled the cage

La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la (Fuck me)
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la (Ooh)
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la (Fuck me)
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la

Baby, don't you know that I got that power?
Raining down on you like an April shower
Coming out your mouth, keep it sweet and sour
Burning inside me, an eternal flower
Baby, shut your mouth, put your body on me
You got my attention, but it isn't for keeps
Every woman knows that the world is ours
'Cause everybody knows that sex is power

I know you, I'd risk for this
I've been stuck in chrysalis
Like a bloody butterfly
I had to grown you wings to fly
Fly away and escape
Find your hands and use the man

Baby, don't you know that I got that power?
Raining down on you like an April shower
Coming out your mouth, keep it sweet and sour
Burning inside me, an eternal flower
Baby, shut your mouth, put your body on me
You got my attention, but it isn't for keeps
Every woman knows that the world is ours
'Cause everybody knows that sex is power

Ooh
We're in power mode (Ooh)
No turning back, back to explode
'Cause, baby, we're in power mode
