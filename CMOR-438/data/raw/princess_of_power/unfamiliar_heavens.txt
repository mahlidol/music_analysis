I couldn't imagine life without your love, love
I don't know what happened, but I never got enough
Grew up as a young girl without your love, love, love, love
Grew up in the mountains wrapped around me like a hug
And you were ever distant, and I felt so ashamed
You didn't seem to love me, but we shared the same last name

I always choose the hells I know
I never let the angels show

Me unfamiliar heavens
Are slowly opening
I see them in the distance
And the color of the sky is changing

For years, I would choose the hells
That felt familiar
Boys and toys and places
Wanted to keep my devils near (Ooh)
Didn't think I deserved
To be loved, loved, loved, loved
'Til I left my hometown
Set myself free like a dog
And you have never heard this
'Cause you didn't want the truth
But I'm so sick of lying
I have nothing left to lose

I always choose the hells I know
I never let the angels show

Me unfamiliar heavens
Are slowly opening
I see them in the distance
And the color of the sky is changing

It's finally over (Ah)
It's in the past now (Ooh)
It's finally over (Ah)
It's in the past now (Ooh)

We choose the things we know
Do we choose to let them go?
And now, my heart has changed
So, I let go over pain

'Cause unfamiliar heavens
Are slowly opening
I see them in the distance
And the color of the sky is changing

It's finally over (Ah)
It's in the past now (Ooh)
It's finally over (Ah)
It's in the past now (Ooh)
