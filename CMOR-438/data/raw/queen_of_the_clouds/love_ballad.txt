Chop off my hands
Chop off my feet
I'd do it for you
Ain't love sweet?

Jump off a cliff
I'd give you my last spliff
I'd do it for you
Ain't love sweet?

Stab my heart, bleeding out
If you feel doubt about me loving you
'Cause, oh, I do

Pour gasoline on me
Oh, yes. I'd burn slowly
So that you feel
I am for real

'Cause this is my one true sacrifice
It never gets old
No need for you to roll the dice
I'm the one to hold
'Cause this is my one true sacrifice
It never gets old
No need for you to roll the dice

Getting in fights
If you say it's right
Shoot them all down
Ain't love sweet?

Breathing your air
Addictive, I swear
I'll never leave
Ain't love sweet?

Stab my heart, bleeding out
If you feel doubt about me loving you
'Cause, oh, I do

Pour gasoline on me
Oh, yes. I'd burn slowly
So that you'd feel
I am for real

'Cause this is my one true sacrifice
It never gets old
No need for you to roll the dice
I'm the one to hold
'Cause this is my one true sacrifice
It never gets old
No need for you to roll the dice

'Cause I'm the one to hold

'Cause you know I would stab my heart, bleeding out
If you feel doubt about me loving you
'Cause, oh, I do

Pour gasoline on me
You know I'd burn slowly
So that you'd feel I am for real

'Cause this is my one true sacrifice
It never gets old
No need for you to roll the dice
I'm the one to hold
'Cause this is my one true sacrifice
It never gets old
No need for you to roll the dice
