Heads turn your body burn rip off your clothes for me
Make out, lash out keep dancing naked, feeling free

That's my gun
That's my gun
That's my gun
Mm mm-hmm (hmm-hmm)
Mm mm-hmm (hmm-hmm)

Last night you were who you prefer because of me
Wake up messed up but you're still happy as can be

That's my gun
That's my gun
That's my gun
Mm mm-hmm (hmm-hmm)
Mm mm-hmm (hmm-hmm)

Do you think I'm easy?
Ooh-ooh
Boy, if you're gonna shoot me down
Do it gently
I'm not easy
Ooh-ooh
But go ahead and touch me now
Do it gently

You're fine, you're mine
I'm the mistake you wanna make
Hey ho, let's go
It's one more chance you gotta take

That's my gun
That's my gun
That's my gun
Mm mm-hmm (hmm-hmm)
Mm mm-hmm (hmm-hmm)

I'm ace in space
And, oh, I know you want to fly
My tune, your moon
Jump on my cloud and we go high

That's my gun
That's my gun
That's my gun
Mm mm-hmm (hmm-hmm)
Mm mm-hmm (hmm-hmm)

Do you think I'm easy?
Ooh-ooh
Boy, if you're gonna shoot me down
Do it gently

Ooh-ooh
But go ahead and touch me now
Do it gently
