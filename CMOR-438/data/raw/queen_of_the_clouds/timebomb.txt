You made your way in as I was leaving
You cut in line just as I was getting my stuff
And I couldn't decide if you were the most annoying human being I'd ever met
Or just the best thing that ever happened
Just the best thing that ever happened

You took the key out of the ignition
I could hear the rain on the windows
Right then and there I made up my mind to just go with it -
Thinking what's the worst thing that could happen?
When the worst thing that could happen, could be the best thing ever

We're not forever you're not the one
We're not forever you're not the one
We're not forever you're not the one
You and I could be the best thing ever

We're not happily ever after
We don't got what it takes
And we don't make plans
Cause we're never gonna last

We're not forever you're not the one
You and I, we're a timebomb
Bomb bomb bomb
Bomb bomb bomb bomb
We're not forever you're not the one
You and I, we're a timebomb (Bomb bomb bomb bomb...)

I shut the door and I don't look back
When something this good comes along you're better off letting the first time be the last time, but really?
What's the worst thing that could happen
When the worst thing that could happen
Could be the best thing ever

We're not forever you're not the one
We're not forever you're not the one
We're not forever you're not the one
You and I could be the best thing ever

We're not happily ever after
We don't got what it takes
And we don't make plans
Cause we're never gonna last

We're not forever you're not the one
You and I, we're a timebomb
Bomb bomb bomb
Bomb bomb bomb bomb
We're not forever you're not the one
You and I, we're a timebomb (Bomb bomb bomb bomb...)

Ooh, we could be the best thing ever

Oh we, could be (we could be the best thing ever)
The best, thing, ever (we could be the best thing ever)

Ooh, forever (we could be the best thing ever)
Oh we (we're not forever), could be (your not the one), the best
You and I, we're a timebomb
Bomb bomb bomb
Bomb bomb bomb bomb
We're not forever
You're not the one
You and I, we're a timebomb (Bomb bomb bomb bomb...)
