Down on the corner, polyphonic visions
All the eyes were diamonds, Technicolor wishes
Five-star paranoia, Hi-Fi superstition
Time to drop the needle, show 'em what they're missin'
Chase it, we'll all fake it 'til we forget
Turn the lights down and keep chasin'
Are we vibin' or just lyin'? Yeah, we're vibin'

Dance, dance, dance
Everybody dance, dance, dance

Ah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Ah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Ah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ah-oh

Down on the corner out on the city
All the girls got money, all the boys look pretty
The velvet tongues are talkin', all the lips are kissin'
Time to drop the needle, show 'em what they're missin'
Chase it, we'll all fake it 'til we forget
Turn the lights down and keep chasin'
Are we vibin' or just lyin'? Yeah, we're vibin'

Ah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Ah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Ah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ah-oh

Dance, dance, dance
Everybody dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
Everybody dance, dance, dance

Ah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Ah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Ah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Ah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ah-oh
