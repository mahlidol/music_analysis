All my life, I read between the lines
Held on too tight, you know I tried
But in the end, it left me paralyzed
It's alright, goodbye, goodbye
Seems like yesterday I was a child
Just a ripple in the folds of time
I wish you well, I want to see you smile
It's alright, goodbye
Goodbye

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I won't cry, I won't cry, I won't cry
Lord knows how hard we tried
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

So many things I want to say to you
So many sleepless nights I prayed for you
My heart's an ashtray and I lost my mind
You bring the smokes, I've got the time
I want to scream, I want to laugh, I want to close my eyes
I want to hide somewhere that's hard to find
Stop wasting time trying to shape your life
It's alright, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I won't cry, I won't cry, I won't cry
Lord knows how hard we tried
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

My pretty bird, my favorite lullaby
How'd I become the thorn in your side?
All your laughter turned into a cry
It's alright, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I won't cry, I won't cry, I won't cry
Lord knows how hard we tried
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
