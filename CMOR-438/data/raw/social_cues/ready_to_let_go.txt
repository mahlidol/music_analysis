Sun went down, sun went down, over Pompeii
On both sides the vow was broken
Oh my my, I'm the one
Tryin' to hide this damage done
One day, all our secrets will be spoken

As we slow danced, I became your statue, frozen
Times I wonder, are we just a puff of smoke? Yeah
Underneath this bed of ashes still withholding everything
Like we were never close

Don't you worry baby
No sense tryin' to change it
I'ma strike these matches
Never had control
I'm ready to let go no
Was I foolin' myself
I'ma spread these ashes
Never had control
I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready to let go

Sun went down, sun went down, over Pompeii
On holy ground our vows were broken
We met up we broke bread
I was blue, your dress was red, ain't it strange?
We both knew this day was comin'

As we slow danced, I became your statue, frozen
Times I wonder, are we just a puff of smoke? Yeah
Underneath this bed of ashes still withholding everything
Like we were never close

Don't you worry baby
No sense tryin' to change it
I'ma strike these matches
Never had control
I'm ready to let go no
Was I foolin' myself
I'ma spread these ashes
Never had control
I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready to let go

Don't you worry baby
No sense tryin' to change it
I'ma strike these matches
Never had control
I'm ready to let go no
Was I foolin' myself
I'ma spread these ashes
Never had control
I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready to let go
