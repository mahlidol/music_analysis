Slowly drift across the floor, can't escape from my mind
Yet I feel like moving on, but I'm stuck taking my time
A window, a sparrow, a spare room, a shadow
Tied to the place where I told you

I'm so sorry, honey, for what I'm becoming
Everything you wanted seems so far from me
Never meant to hurt you, no, never meant to make you cry
I'm so sorry, honey, for what I'm becoming

Caught me walkin' through the walls, still there's nothing I find
Took the picture from the frame, am I wasting my time?
A stranger, the basement, a table, the pavement
Tied to the place where I left you

I'm so sorry, honey, for what I'm becoming
Everything you wanted seems so far from me
Never meant to hurt you, no, never meant to make you cry
I'm so sorry, honey, for what I'm becoming

Never meant to hurt you, no
Never meant to make you cry
Never meant to hurt you, no
Never meant to hurt you

I'm so sorry, honey, for what I'm becoming
Everything you wanted seems so far from me
Never meant to hurt you, no, never meant to make you cry
I'm so sorry, honey, for what I'm becoming
