You found me lost in a daydream
Feelin' I've been awake too long
My eyes are open while my heart keeps sinking
Deeper 'til the days are gone

Doesn't mean I couldn't believe it
Doesn't mean I won't believe it still
Every lie is true at the time, baby
That's the thrill

Oh, won't you let me down, let me down
Let me down easy if you're gonna let me down?
If you're gonna let me down
Let me down easy if you're gonna let me down
Don't you go and tell me that you love me
While you're leavin' if you're gonna leave me now, oh
If you're gonna let me down
Let me down easy if you're gonna let me down

I could see us waving in the distance
Like a mirage on sand
That could be us trading secrets
No one else could understand

I got you under my skin now
Why do you make it so hard?
Don't leave me broken and free
Won't you tell me where you are?

Oh, won't you let me down, let me down
Let me down easy if you're gonna let me down?
If you're gonna let me down
Let me down easy if you're gonna let me down
Don't you go and tell me that you love me
While you're leavin' if you're gonna leave me now, oh
If you're gonna let me down
Let me down easy if you're gonna let me down

If you're gonna let me down, let me down
Let me down easy if you're gonna let me down
If you're gonna let me down
Let me down easy if you're gonna let me down
Don't you go and tell me that you love me
While you're leavin' if you're gonna leave me now, oh
If you're gonna let me down
Let me down easy if you're gonna let me down
