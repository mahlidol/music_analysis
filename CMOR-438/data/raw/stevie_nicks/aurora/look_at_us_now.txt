I don't know who I am
Baby, baby, baby
Do you know who you are?
Is it out of our hands?
Tell me, tell me, tell me
How we made it this far

Did we unravel a long time ago?
Is there too much we don't wanna know?
I wish it was easy, but it isn't so

Oh, we could make a good thing bad
Oh, we could make a good thing bad

Now, where do we stand?
Baby, baby, baby
No one knows who you are
And if this was your plan
Tell me, tell me why
You've been cryin' in the dark

We unraveled a long time ago
We lost and we couldn't let it go
I wish it was easy, but it isn't so
So, baby

Oh, we could make a good thing bad
Oh, we could make a good thing bad
Oh, we could make a good thing bad
Oh, we could make a good thing bad

How did we get here? How do we get out?
We used to be somethin' to see
Oh, baby, look at us now
Oh, baby, look at us now
This thing we've been doin' ain't workin' out
Why can't you just admit it to me?
Oh, baby, look at us now
Oh, baby, look at us now
Oh, baby, look at us now
Oh, baby, look at us now
Oh, baby, look at us now
How did we get here? How do we get out?
This thing we've been doin' ain't workin' out
Oh, how did we get here? How do we get out?
We used to be something to see
Oh, baby, look at us now
Baby, look at us now
This thing we've been doin' ain't workin' out
Why can't you just admit it to me?
Oh, baby, look at us now
Baby, look at us now
How did we get here? How do we get out?
We used to be something to see
Oh, baby, look at us now
Baby, look at us now
This thing we've been doin' ain't workin' out
Why can't you just admit it to me?
Oh, baby, look at us now
Baby, look at us now

Oh, we could make a good thing bad
Oh, we could make a good thing bad
