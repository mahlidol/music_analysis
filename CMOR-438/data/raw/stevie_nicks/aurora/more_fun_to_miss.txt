Ooh-ah

I still need a drink for all the glasses in the sink
From chasin' a shot that rang through hell
For the record, I'm fine with what's left of what's mine
Almost took you by mistake for someone else

You're just a wild guess in a see-through dress
I don't wanna hear you squealin' up my drive
It took guts to think that I would buy that wink
But that little thing you do just ain't right

(You'd be more fun to miss)
Than to be with
(You'd be more fun to kiss)
Than to be with
(You'd be more fun to miss)
Than to be with

Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah

I still want this night upside down and up-right
Oh, that's how my little mind gets fed
Now, do I shoot straight or do I cheat fate?
Oh, it does a number on my head

But I don't pull tricks and last time I hit a lick
Was when I heard the church a-bells a-chiming
But you'd be just as fun as a jammed-up gun
Another shot at just the wrong place and time

(You'd be more fun to miss)
Than to be with
(You'd be more fun to kiss)
Than to be with
(You'd be more fun to miss)
Than to be with

Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah

You'd be more fun to miss
(Than to be with)
You'd be more fun to kiss
(Than to be with)
You'd be more fun to miss
(Than to be with)
You'd be more fun to miss

Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah
