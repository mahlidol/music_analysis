You regret me and I'll regret you
Except I don't care what you feel and I totally already do
I'm the slippage in the system with a natural gift, how I move
So go ahead and regret me, but I'm beatin' you to it, dude

(Ah) You regret me and I'll regret you
You couldn't handle your liquor and you can't seem to handle the truth
I'm the slippage in the system and I'm perfectly ready to strike
So go ahead and regret me, but I'm not easin' up on this mic

Seven fallen angels in a tumbler
Meet me in the parlor with your keys
Meet me in the corner where you keep me
I'll do anything you please
I'll do anything you please

You regret me and I'll regret you
I find it perfectly natural here in my car to be doing
Off the PCH highway with the typical wonderful view
Go ahead and regret me, but I'm beatin' you to it, dude

Go ahead and regret me, but I always will too regret you
Go ahead and regret me, but I always will too regret you
Go ahead and regret me, but I always will too regret you
