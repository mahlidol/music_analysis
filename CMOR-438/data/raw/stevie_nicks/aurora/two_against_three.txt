The days were wide open
At the heart of all my joy
Boys were invincible lovers
Just begging to be destroyed
They're up in the morning
Regretfully sobbing and gone
I'm bathed and going back to bed
This was never any cause for alarm

Mm, it seems you have a choice to make
The shell is white and yours to break
Either way, it's just as well
All I need's a promise I can keep to myself

They live with their lovers
Who all talk aloud in their sleep
Driftin' off into a dreamland
Never as quiet as they seem to be
I know our mornings
Were as good as it ever could be
Listening to our hearts a-beatin'
Tenderly, two against three

It seems you have a choice to make
The shell is white and yours to break
Either way, it's just as well
All I need's a promise I can keep to myself

I'm nowhere near you
Nowhere near where I should be
Feelin' our hearts a-beatin'
Tenderly, two against three
