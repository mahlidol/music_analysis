Crying in the morning... trying to be strong
Waiting for the spring to turn into the fall
Love don't mean what it says at all
My destiny says that I'm destined to fall

My destiny is riding again
Rolling in the rain... unwinding in the wind
My destiny is fighting again
Secretly unwinding...
What it was I was supposed to say...
To say to you today

It wasn't like the others... it was nothing at all
It wasn't like anything... it was easy to fall
Love don't mean what it says at all
My destiny says that I'm destined for it all

My destiny is riding again
Rolling in the rain... unwinding in the wind
My destiny is fighting again
Secretly unwinding...
What it was that I was supposed to say...
To say to you today


Crying...

Still crying in the morning... trying to be strong
Waiting for the spring to turn into the fall
Love never meant what it said at all
My destiny proved I was destined to fall

My destiny is riding again
Rolling in the rain... unwinding in the wind
My destiny is fighting again
Secretly unwinding...
What it was that I was supposed to say...
To say to you today

I am crying... I am trying... to be strong...
Heartbroken... unspoken...
You were nothing like the others
You were nothing like the others
All gone... nothing left at all
