Papa says... there are clothes to wash
Sister says... brush your hair
You'll go down... to the laundromat
Maybe your sister is there
Father says... when you're young like this...
Things can seem... pretty bad
Let's get out... and walk by the river

And there are people who roam the Docklands
And there are ships passing in the night
And there are thousands of things that I have dreamed
Gone in the daylight

Sister says... hold your head up high
Life goes on... so don't be afraid
Keep your defenses... but don't shut the loving out
You got to learn to carry that weight

And all the people who roam the Docklands
And all the ships passing through the night
And there are thousands of things that I have dreamed
Gone in the daylight
Sometimes I feel like I'm in a foreign land
And there's a mirror I'm looking through
Lost in the place where I was born
Without a hand to hold on to

Hold on... (Hold on... )
Hold on... (Hold on... )

In the Docklands where I was born...
People keep moving to and fro
Everybody's pushing... trying to make it happen
I... beg of you... (I) I beg of you... (l) I beg of you...

I miss you... more than I thought I could
I need you... more than you know
I was there... when they took you away from me
I'll be there... when they let you go

And then the people who roam the Docklands
And all the ships passing in the night
And the thousands of things that I have dreamed
Stay in the daylight
Sometimes I feel like I'm in a foreign land
And there's a mirror I'm looking through
Well bring me back to the place where I was born
Without a hand to hold on to
Give me your hand
Give me your hand... (Give me your hand)
Give me your hand... in the Docklands
I... beg of you... give me your hand...
In the Docklands
