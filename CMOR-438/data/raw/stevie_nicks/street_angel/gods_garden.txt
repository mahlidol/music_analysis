Through the mist I see her face
Looking down on me
Don't know the time, don't know the place
Let her eyes watch over me
She comes in deepest sleep
Can't help but fall at her feet
Won't let her in for all I've seen
This I will take to my grave
I see her walk on water
Head held up high
Playing in God's garden
I'll be there to hold you when you cry
The path grown over through the years
Walking on the pain towards my fears
Talking to myself for comforts sake
Holding on so I won't break
Sometimes I hear angels sing
Their tears wash away my sins
Don't know what my destiny will bring
Just spend eternity with me
