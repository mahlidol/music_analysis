Such a little girl... such a hard life
She could look a challenge... right between the eyes
Disappointment... would become her middle name...
Up against the wall, Jane
So her nights became nightmares...
As she fought for their souls
And the days became worse...
For the ones she had lost
Children of the world...
The forgotten chimpanzee
In the eyes of the world...
You have done so much for me

There are angels... here on earth... angels
There are angels... here on earth...
Angels... sent from God
Come away from the wall... stay with us
Well you can, Jane

So she watched as they put them all into cages
Well they might as well have caged her very own baby
They might as well have put us both into prison
Through a window... all our sorrows...
Would become our only visions...
Nothing more

There are angels here... angels
There are angels here on earth... angels
You will never feel... that you have ever done enough
But you have, Jane

Such a little girl... such a hard life
You could look a challenge... straight between the eyes
Disappointment... would become her middle name
Up against the wall, Jane
Nothing more than the shadow of a man
Come away from the wall, Jane
Well they might as well have put us both into prison
Come away... if you can, Jane
Through a window... all our sorrows...
Will become our only visions
Come away, Jane...
Come away... come away if you can

In the eyes of the world... you have done so much
