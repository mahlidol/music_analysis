I'll stay with you one more night
I'll bid you no goodbyes
Not until tomorrow's light...
Then I'll say goodnight
I would really rather die...
Than make you stop
I think that is the meaning of love

I think that is the meaning of love
And I prefer to kick it
Yes I think that is the meaning of love
And I prefer to kick it... kick the habit

Well I'm waited for in Egypt...
It's just something I must do
Yes I can see you're waited for... all over you
All day and all night... all over the world
It's your world

I think that is the meaning of love
And I'm prepared to kick it
Yes I think that is the meaning of love
And I prefer to kick it

So what is this... when you can
What is this... what about me
What is this... (What is this)
I understand... (I understand)
What is this... I'm lonely... I'm lonely... (I'm lonely)


It's a strange kind of love affair...
A symphony of sorts
Strange kind of love affair...
A declaration of war
No I won't be here tomorrow night...
You won't see me smiling
Tomorrow when it's very dark... No crying...

I think that is the meaning of love
And I prefer to kick it
Yes I think that is the meaning of love...
Surrender...
Well I think that is the meaning of love
I think that is the meaning of love... (love)
And I prefer to kick it
Yes I think that is the meaning of love (love... love)
But I prefer to kick it
Well I loved you more than life itself
(Nothing like forever more)
But I'm prepared to kick it
(Something like dying)
Yes I loved you more than life itself (love... love)
But I'm prepared to kick it
