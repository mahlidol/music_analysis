Well you're a front liner...
You put it all on the line
And you're a gambler...
You turn lucky every time
Ooh, you're consistent...
Hey, and that's good
And you're persistent...
Well I am overcome


Well you're not like anyone else
(You're not like anyone)
You're just an instant flash of light
That shines through the night like a lighthouse

Well you're a victim...
Phantom of the opera
And you've been everywhere...
And you live in dark shadows
You do what you want to...
There's no Beauty and the Beast here
No... no... no...
There's no Beauty and the Beast here


Well you're not like anyone else
(You're not like anyone)
You're just an instant flash of light
That shines...

Well open up the window...
And you will hear the rain
Come back to me once more...
And throw away the pain

My world will still revolve around you
(Listen to the rain)
Take time... to listen to the rain
(Listen to the rain)
Take time baby... to listen to the rain


(Well she didn't know better)
Well she didn't know then that the sound that she heard
(Well she didn't know)
Was the sound of her own door... closing

Open up the window...
And listen to the rain
Take some time to smell the roses...
And you can throw away the pain
My world will still revolve around you
(So listen to the rain)
Take time baby... to listen to the rain
(And listen to the rain)
Take time... and listen to the rain
(And listen to the rain)
Well take time... and listen to the rain
(Take time baby... a little time baby)
Ooh take time honey... take a little time honey
Take time... to listen to the rain
(Take time baby... a little time baby...
And listen to the rain)
