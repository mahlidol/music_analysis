You used to call me wicked
I used to call you friend
They say your life is wild
Compared to what... lifestyle
You must have many things... to remember
Cause nothing else in your life has really changed
Everything is almost... like it was before
And I don't want to do this... anymore

When you lose your sight (Love is like a river)
And there's nothing to see (Love is like a river)
She was just like me (Love is like a river)
And suddenly... the day comes

Some call it love...
Some say they're above that
Well I believed in love...
I called it worth it

Some call me... all the time (Love is like a river)
Well love is like a river (Love is like a river)
And when you lose your sight
And suddenly... the day comes


Everything all around me is electric now
But I haven't burned a candle in a real long time
And only when your heart says it's over does it die
Well love is like a river... running...
Straight back to the sea

Some call it love...
Some say they're above it... (above that)
Well I believed in love...
I called it worth it... (worth it)...

Well some call me all the time
(Love is like a river)
I say you can't stay home and give up the fight
(Love is like a river)
I think you're uptight lady... ooh, out of sight
That's just what I wanted to hear... ooh, out of sight
You know you can't stay home
In the middle of the night
Love is like a river
You can't say no in the middle of the night
(Love is like a river)
I think you're uptight lady... ooh, out of sight
And you can't say no in the middle of the night
Love is like a river
Well I think you're uptight lady... uptight lady...
Ooh, out of sight... out of sight, baby
