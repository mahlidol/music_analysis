I'm beside myself...
Cause I don't know... and you won't tell
Your distant world has somehow pulled me in
It's so surreal...
So out of time with you it feels
To give again...
But you don't need a thing

Maybe love will change your mind
Maybe this time
Maybe love will change your mind
Maybe this time

A look... a touch
Just because I wanted them...
To mean so much...
You might not feel the same
The day would end...
And you'd go back to where you've been
A kiss for luck
I wish you could have stayed

Maybe love will change your mind
Maybe this time
Maybe love will make it clear
Oh, what words would keep you here
Maybe love will reach your heart
Thought I saw it in the dark
Maybe love will change your mind
Maybe this time

You want me to be there
You take me somewhere
You show me your lifeline
Reveal your other side
I would say but the words won't come
I just come undone
All I want to do... is to be closer to you


La la la... la la... La la la... la la

Maybe love will change your mind
Maybe this time
Maybe love will make it clear
Oh, what words would keep you here
Maybe love will reach your heart
Thought I saw it in the dark
Maybe love will change your mind
This time... Maybe love...
Maybe love...
Well you want me to be there with you
Well there's nothing more I'd rather do...
