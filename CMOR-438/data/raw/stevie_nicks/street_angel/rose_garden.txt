You never promised me a Rose Garden
You never said it would be easy
You never promised me a leisure lifetime
You only said you'd never leave me

Well I never took the time to realize
How much I needed love in order to survive
I was so spoiled... a princess in my time
And your love was so deep
And mine... so blind

You never promised me a ring made out of diamonds
A band of gold you said was all you could buy
You never said I'd be a rich man's lady
And oh my darling... no, you never lied

Well I never took the time to realize
How much I needed love in order to survive
I was so spoiled... a princess in my time
And your love was so deep
And mine... so blind


And now you're gone... and I'm alone, and I'm so lonely
Nothing seems to be the same
One day I turned around and you no longer loved me
In my life there's been a big change

Now... I've a big house
With pillars standing tall all around
Yeah, and I've got a garden
And it's got roses dangling down to the ground
Yes, and I've got money
Men to love me... and acres of land
Well, I've got all these things...
All these things but a small gold band
On my finger... on my left hand
Oh no... you never promised...
You never promised... me a Rose Garden
