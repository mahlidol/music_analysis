Rhinestone collections all the time
I wonder what Greta would say...

Another lady... another time...
Another heartbroken state of mind
Alone in her chambers... she dreams of her home
Outside... she's got a movie star view
Outcries... well where will the kings go...
Where will the kings go now?
She's got her eyes wide open...
And she's ready to stare you down
She says in words unspoken... she's from out of town
Well some cry... well I really don't dance down
Stormy weather... it cuts like a knife

She's got her bags packed...
And she's off to the valley where the
Sun meets the sea
You understand that...
She wants to live by the ocean...
And no one is pleased
She gets a house in the mountains...
The next day... the next day she leaves the station


Do you really want to change her...
Or is it your right?

Ooh... alone in her chambers she dreams of her home
In a very real way... she's the purist art form
I bet she said... just how many art lovers can one
Get to know?
She doesn't have an hour...
She doesn't have five minutes...
She's got to go!

She's got her bags packed...
And she's off to the valley where the
Sun meets the sea
You understand that
She wants to live by the ocean...
And no one is pleased
She gets a house in the mountains...
The next day...
The next day she leaves the station

I wonder what Greta would say
Well I wonder what Greta would say
I wonder what Greta would say
Ooh... she's got a movie star view
Oh... well where will the kings go...
Where will the kings go now?
Say Greta..
