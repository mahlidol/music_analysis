Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand outside the rain
Everybody knows... that baby's got new clothes
But lately he sees her ribbons and her bows...
Have fallen from her curls

She takes... just like a woman... yes she does
She makes love just like a woman... yes she does
And she aches... just like a woman
But she breaks... just like a little girl

Queen Mary... she's my friend
Yes, I believe that I'll go see her again
Nobody has to guess... that baby can't be blessed
Till she finally finds out... that she's like all the rest
With her fog... her amphetamines... and her pills


It was raining from the first
And I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts
But what's worse... is this pain in here
I can't stay in here... ain't it clear...

That I just don't fit
Yes, I believe it's time for me to quit
When we meet again... introduced as friends
Well please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry... and it was your world

I fake... just like a woman... yes I do
I make love just like a woman... yes I do
And I ache... just like a woman
But I break... yes I break... like a little... girl
(She takes... just like a woman)
She makes love...
(She makes love just like a woman)
She takes love...
(She aches... just like a woman)
Oh, but she breaks... yes she breaks...
