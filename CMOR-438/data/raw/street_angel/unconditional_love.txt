Don't explain...
Just lay back and watch the rain
Cause darling I'm right here...
And nothing's changed
Don't you know by now...
I would not even know how
To keep myself from falling for you
I'll be around

Unconditional love...
I'll be there when you fall
The one condition of love...
Is there are none at all

Why would I...
Be a fool and break these ties
When all the dreams that I believe
Are in your eyes
Don't you see at last...
You don't even have to ask
I'll give you so much more
Than just a second chance


(Hey, hey, hey... my precious one)
(Hey, hey, hey... my precious one)
