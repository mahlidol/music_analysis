He's gone, he's gone
You're better off I'm glad that he's gone
He's gone, he's gone
You're better off I'm glad that he's gone

I got a girlfriend, she's got a boyfriend
She calls me cryin' everyday 'cause they got problems
He likes complainin', she's compromisin'
Coming to me for real advice when he's just playin'

I can tell she loves him way too deep
He loves being fuckin' hard to please
Cover the basics, it's pretty easy
He's a bitch with some expectations

Did you go down on his birthday? (Yup)
Did you let him leave a necklace? (Yup)
Or did you show him all your crazy? (No)
Blow him up on the weekends? (Hmm)
Did you give into his ego
Just to give a little confidence?
I think you know it's time to let go
(You're better off I'm glad that he's gone)
(Oh baby)

Never no tears for that sucker
Only one dick that's a bummer
Dancing all night, get guys' numbers
(Better off I'm glad that he's gone)
Baby no tears for that sucker
We'll never go dry this whole summer
Wanna get over? Get under

(Better off I'm glad that he's gone)
(He's gone, he's gone)
(You're better off I'm glad that he's gone)

Bitch I love you, he never loved you
He never saw the pretty things in you that I do
I missed your madness, you're kinda ratchet
We used to go out every night, get into bad shit

You and me under each other's wing
We were free till he spoiled everything
Cover the basics, it's pretty easy
He's a bitch with some expectations

You and me under each other's wing
But he spoiled everything
Bitch I love you, he never loved you
(He never loved you, my baby)
