Ask me for my cigarette
Just so he can taste my lips and start to work me
Calculate his every step
Feel his hands around my hips, here comes the head tip
Kiss him in the French way (Oh-la-la-la)
Professionally passionate head to a private place
So I can reciprocate (Oh-la-la-la)
Let me be an astronaut locked in your head space

Je m'appelle Jacques and I love you a lot
I'm with you tonight, but tomorrow I will not
Je m'appelle Tove, get the show on the road
I'm down for one night, let's go (Oh-la-la-la)

No talking now, pull on my waist (Oh-la-la-la)
'Cause I want you doing mad things to me (Oh-la-la-la)
Always on top, I need a change (Oh-la-la-la)
Come over here, just want your weight on me (Oh-la-la-la)

I just want you on me
I just want you on me

Yeah, I kinda look like the view
On a mission to position myself right underneath you
Boy, that was good for me (Oh-la-la-la)
Don't really do this but, hey, you wanna go again?

Je m'appelle Jacques and I love you a lot
I'm with you tonight, but tomorrow I will not
Je m'appelle Tove, get the show on the road
I'm down for one night, let's go (Oh-la-la-la)

No talking now, pull on my waist (Oh-la-la-la)
'Cause I want you doing mad things to me (Oh-la-la-la)
Always on top, I need a change (Oh-la-la-la)
Come over here, just want your weight on me (Oh-la-la-la)

I just want you on me
I just want you on me

Touch me, touch me, touch me
A little
Touch me, touch me, touch me
A little
Touch me, touch me, touch me
A little
Touch me, touch me, touch me
A little
Touch me, touch me, touch me
A little
Touch me, touch me, touch me
A little
Touch me, touch me, touch me
No talking now, no talking now, no talking now, no talking now

No talking now, pull on my waist
'Cause I want you doing mad things to me, to me
Always on top, I need a change
Come over here, just want your weight on me, on me
I just want you on me
I just want you on me
