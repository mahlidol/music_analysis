Love all my moods and keep me off the deep end
Midsummer's pool and I fill it with secrets
You're gonna get what you're givin' to me
You're gonna get what you're givin' to me
Watch me break down and then use it against me
Watching me drown like a beach on the concrete
You're gonna get what you're givin' to me
You're gonna get what you're givin' to me

Passion's got a thousand faces
But none of them will play the realest
Mirror all the ways I'm 'lone
Spiking all my right brain senses
I'm naive, impulsive even
Falling too fast
I'm forgetful, when it's hurtful
Why let it last?

You're gonna get what you're givin' to me
You're gonna get what you're givin' to me
All that good shit on the table to eat
Passion and pain taste the same when I'm weak

If you break my bones, if you br-
I'ma hurt my soul, I'ma h-

Broken cassette with the love songs repeating
Follow my pattern in darkness, I see it
I see an end, I pretend that I don't
Sayin' I'll stay, I'm afraid that I won't
If you break my bones, I'ma hurt my soul
Gonna fuck it out again and again, mmm
Stuff me full off lies that I swallow down
You're gonna get what you're givin' to me
You're gonna get what you're givin' to me, hmm

Passion's got a thousand faces
But none of them will play the realest
Mirror all the ways I'm 'lone
Spiking all my right brain senses
I'm naive, impulsive even
Falling too fast
I'm forgetful, when it's hurtful
Why let it last?

You're gonna get what you're givin' to me
You're gonna get what you're givin' to me
All that good shit on the table to eat
Passion and pain taste the same when I'm weak

If you break my bones, if you br-
I'ma hurt my soul, I'ma h-
Break my bones, swallow down
You're gonna get what you're givin' to me

You're gonna get what you're givin' to me
You're gonna get what you're givin' to me
All that good shit on the table to eat
Passion and pain taste the same when I'm weak
