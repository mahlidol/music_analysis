Scanning you up and down
See you got curves in all the places that count
Only you in the crowd
He's looking at you and he looks happier now

Why? Why? Why?
Why did I go to this party?
Thought I was done feeling sorry
Knew he'd be here with somebody
Why did it have to be you?

I know I've got no right to
I know I've got no right to
Really I just don't like you
Look prettier than I do tonight
You make it hard to have a good time
(Time, time, time)

I know I've got no right to
I know I've got no right to
Really I just don't like you
Look prettier than I do tonight
You make it hard to have a good time
(Time, time, time)

None of it is your fault
And when I hate on you I'm breaking the code
But you got him, I don't, I don't
Hard to be fair to you when I got my heart broke

Why? Why? Why?
Why did I go to this party?
Thought I was done feeling sorry
Knew he'd be here with somebody
Why did it have to be you?

I know I've got no right to
I know I've got no right to
Really I just don't like you
Look prettier than I do tonight
You make it hard to have a good time
(Time, time, time)

I know I've got no right to
I know I've got no right to
Really I just don't like you
Look prettier than I do tonight
You make it hard to have a good time
(Time, time, time)

I'm gonna try
Till my eyes and these drinks run dry
Till I, I don't feel anything
Oh, why?

Why did I go to this party?
Why did it have to be you?

I know I've got no right to
I know I've got no right to
Really I just don't like you
Look prettier than I do tonight
You make it hard to have a good time
(Time, time, time)

I know I've got no right to
I know I've got no right to
Really I just don't like you
Look prettier than I do tonight
You make it hard to have a good time
(Time, time, time)

You know how it feels
I wish it wasn't real
But you know how it feels
