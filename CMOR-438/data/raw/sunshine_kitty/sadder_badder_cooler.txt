I'm sadder, I'm badder, I'm cooler, yeah
I'm sadder, I'm badder, I'm cooler, yeah
Than I was when I met you
Than I was when I met you, oh yeah (Yeah)
I'm sadder, I'm badder, I'm cooler, yeah (Yeah)

You toast your friends 'cause I left
But you know I'm never coming back in
Once I walk out the door
Screw our loose ends in this war
It was all about the power play, babe
And I can't do it no more

Heartbreak pays bills
You lose, I win

I'm sadder, I'm badder, I'm cooler, yeah
I'm sadder, I'm badder, I'm cooler, yeah
Than I was when I met you (Sadder, badder, cooler)
Than I was when I met you, oh yeah (Yeah)
I'm sadder (Sadder, badder, cooler), I'm badder
I'm cooler, yeah (Yeah)

Love a good cry in the night
Oh, this sad girl life, just do it for me
Come to my pity party
Done with my pride, I don't mind
I just wanna be dramatic tonight
And make this song about me

Heartbreak pays bills
You lose, I win

I'm sadder, I'm badder, I'm cooler, yeah
I'm sadder, I'm badder, I'm cooler, yeah
Than I was when I met you (Sadder, badder, cooler)
Than I was when I met you, oh yeah (Yeah)
I'm sadder (Sadder, badder, cooler), I'm badder
I'm cooler, yeah (Yeah)

Ooh (Sadder, badder, cooler)
Why am I cooler than you? (Yeah)
Ooh (Sadder, badder, cooler)
Why am I cooler than you? (Yeah)
(I'm sadder, I'm badder) Ooh (Sadder, badder, cooler)
Why am I cooler than you? (Yeah)
(I'm sadder, I'm badder) Ooh (Sadder, badder, cooler)
Why am I cooler than you? (Yeah)

Sadder, badder, cooler
Yeah
Sadder, badder, cooler
Yeah, yeah
