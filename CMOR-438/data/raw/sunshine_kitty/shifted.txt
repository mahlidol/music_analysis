I listened to what my mama said, yeah
Always been down for a challenge since, yeah
She said it's all 'bout the balance
When you're talking love and the drama
You just can't let it control your life, nah

Took it all to heart and now I'm here with you
Twist my body, tripping, jumping through your hoops
Know I go full crazy but I'm tired too
I just can't let it control my life, nah

Keep me guessing
Think you're pulling me in
I'm not feeling your love
Done putting in work
Sick of waiting
Yeah I'm sick of waiting
When you're shifting your love
Done putting in work
I'm done done, I'm done done
Putting in work
I'm done done, I'm done done
Putting in work
You keep me guessing
Think you're pulling me in
I'm not feeling your love
Done putting in work

My mama was full of shit, what?
Or did I miss the whole point of it, nah
I don't need your validation
It's just a physical pleasure
I just can't let it control my life, nah

Took it all to heart and now I'm here with you
Twist my body, tripping, jumping through your hoops
Know I go full crazy but I'm tired too
I just can't let it control my life, nah

Keep me guessing
Think you're pulling me in
I'm not feeling your love
Done putting in work
Sick of waiting
Yeah I'm sick of waiting
When you're shifting your love
Done putting in work
I'm done done, I'm done done
Putting in work
I'm done done, I'm done done
Putting in work
You keep me guessing
Think you're pulling me in
I'm not feeling your love
Done putting in work

Still hanging on but the heat's dying down
I'm sick of grinding you all over town
Like what you did to me there for a while
I just can't let it control my life, nah

Keep me guessing
Think you're pulling me in
I'm not feeling your love
Done putting in work
Sick of waiting
Yeah I'm sick of waiting
When you're shifting your love
Done putting in work
I'm done done, I'm done done
Putting in work
I'm done done, I'm done done
Putting in work
You keep me guessing
Think you're pulling me in
I'm not feeling your love
Done putting in work
