You gave me my birthday kiss
I gave you a pill, said, "You'll get high off of this."
You hit a few parties that night
I stayed where I was 'cause I hoped that you'd come and find me

See in your eyes, you just went through war
Whatever it was broke your heart
You dip your toes back in, take it slow
Well, I'm nothing like what you had before, so

Already deep in my bed, baby
Why don't you stay over?
Know we've been bending the rules lately
But why don't you stay over?
Fall hard, I know it's fast
You just left her, that's the past
Already deep in my bed, naked
So why don't you stay, stay, stay, stay over?
So why don't you stay, stay, stay over?

You gave me my birthday kiss
I gave you a night that you will never forget
I know that you plan to be free for a while now
But you can be free with me, I've been where you are

See in your eyes, you just went through war
Whatever it was broke your heart
You dip your toes back in, take it slow
Well, I'm nothing like what you had before, so

Already deep in my bed, baby
Why don't you stay over?
Know we've been bending the rules lately
But why don't you stay over?
Fall hard, I know it's fast
You just left her, that's the past
Already deep in my bed, naked (Yeah)
So why don't you stay, stay, stay, stay over?
(Why don't you? Why don't you?)
So why don't you stay, stay, stay over?
(Why don't you? Why don't you?)

Don't back away from this, don't back away
I know it's intense losing your senses in this love
So don't back away from me, don't back away
No, 'cause what we have, I've never felt before, so

Already deep in my bed, baby (Yeah)
Why don't you stay over?
Know we've been bending the rules lately
But why don't you stay over?
Fall hard, I know it's fast
You just left her, that's the past
Already deep in my bed, naked (Yeah)
So why don't you stay, stay, stay, stay over?
(Why don't you? Why don't you?)
So why don't you stay, stay, stay over?
(Why don't you? Why don't you?)
