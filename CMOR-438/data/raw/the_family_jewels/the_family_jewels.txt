I can't break the cycle
Am I just a fool?
Falling down like dominoes
Hit by family jewels

Pass it down from kid to kid
The chain will never end
Unless I decide to go to it
Will I see the end?

Oh, don't you find it strange?
Only thing we share is one last name
Did I beat you at your own game?
Typical of me to put us all to shame

Welcome to the family jewels
Coal to diamonds, sold to fools
Welcome to the family jewels
Simmer and suffer, can't keep his cool
I can't keep my cool
I can't keep my cool

Family said that I decided
To live a loveless life
Is it my fault we stay divided
'Cause I've got too much pride
Pass the parcel, wrap, unwrap
And open up the locks
Out come flying all the secrets
Of Pandora's Box

Oh you think I'm unfit
Little did you know that I was cut for it
No glass slipper will ever fit
'Cause I could never see a diamond in it

Welcome to the family jewels
Coal to diamonds, sold to fools
Welcome to the family jewels
Simmer and suffer, can't keep his cool
I can't keep my cool
I can't keep my cool

And when we're in the dark
It echoes in your heart
And when you're far away
It beckons me to stay

And when we're in the dark
It echoes in your heart
And when you're far away
It beckons me to stay

Welcome to the family jewels
Coal to diamonds, sold to fools
Welcome to the family jewels
Simmer and suffer, can't keep his cool

Welcome to the family jewels
Coal to diamonds, sold to fools
Welcome to the family jewels
Simmer and suffer, can't keep his cool

I can't keep my cool
I can't keep my cool
