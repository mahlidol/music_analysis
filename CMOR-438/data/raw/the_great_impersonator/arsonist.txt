Arsonist, burning down the world to feel its heat
The arsonist doesn't feel the embers on his feet, and
Arsonist, your human starter kit came incomplete
My apologies, arsonist, you loved me

I'm glued to a building that's on fire
Handcuffed to a narcissistic liar
Empty space and lethargy
Eyes ablaze with apathy
Fool me twice, the shame is on me

Am I a victim in your game?
Am I a set of antique plates?
Will you pass me through your bloodline with your ornamental rage?
Can I take the blame for everything you hate?
The punishment and crime are not the same

Arsonist, burning down the world to feel its heat
The arsonist doesn't feel the embers on his feet
And arsonist, your human starter kit came incomplete
My apologies, arsonist, you loved me

You built a small container to keep all of me confined
I am water, I am shapeless, I am fluid, I'm divine
Somebody will love me for the way that I'm designed
Devastation, creation intertwined

You don't love the flames, you just want them for yourself
Douse my head in kerosene, horizon into hell
And you smothered out the glow I grew for you
But it was mine too

Arsonist, burning down the world to feel its heat
The arsonist doesn't feel the embers on his feet
And arsonist, your human starter kit came incomplete
My apologies, arsonist, you loved me

Alchemy's not love, it's playing God
And there's a penance paid for entering a temple like a fraud in your charade
You leave me sleeping in the dark so you can hide away your blade
Then lock the door and trap me right here in the blaze

Arsonist, burning down the world to feel its heat
The arsonist doesn't feel the embers on his feet
And arsonist, your human starter kit came incomplete
My apologies, arsonist, you loved me

Have you ever—
Have you ever been worried that if you—
Have you ever given the world to somebody as a gift and had it returned?
Did you know the father's DNA stays inside the mother for seven years?
Have you ever waited seven years?
Have you ever woken from a dream just to realize that you were still asleep?
Do you ever wish that you were still asleep?
Do you ever wish you wouldn't wake up?
