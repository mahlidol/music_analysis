They're cuttin' her up on the operatin' table, but it wasn't enough
The front desk pages, it's a call for the ages
They couldn't save her, they couldn't save her
The surgeon said, "She had a hole in her heart
But it wasn't her fault, it was there from the start"
Tryin' to love you through an open wound
'Cause everythin' I put inside there just fell right through
And I hold the parts together with some pressure and glue
And you're runnin' in slow-mo to the hospital room
If you only knew
How bad it hurt me too

So now you can take the money, you can get on a plane
To a beautiful island, build a house in my name
You can donate all the money to somebody in pain
And you can rest your head down and not feel any shame
I never loved you
I never loved you
I never loved you in vain

They're sewin' me shut
Openin' the doors and then removin' their gloves
Taking the long way to the end of the hallway
They couldn't save her, they couldn't save her
Told the nurses that we argued a lot
And you're ramblin' on about the last time we fought
You drove off screamin' on the night you were caught
You left me standin' in the parkin' lot
I took off chasin' you down Route 22
'Cause you never listen, and I'm terrible too
You kept on drivin' far away from the issues
If you stopped, I would've kissed you

So now you can take the money, you can get on a plane
To a beautiful island, build a house in my name
You can donate all the money to somebody in pain
And you can rest your head down and not feel any shame
I never loved you
I never loved you
I never loved you in vain

Flash of light, heat of fire
Head on concrete and the screechin' of tires
Sound of sirens, rush of pain
I almost thought I heard you call my name

So now you can take the money, you can get on a plane
To a beautiful island, build a house in my name
You can donate all the money to somebody in pain
And you can rest your head down and not feel any shame
I never loved you
I never loved you
I never loved you in vain
