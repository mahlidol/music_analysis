Please God or whoever you are
Please God or whoever you are
Please God or whoever you are
Please God or whoever you are

These days, I get less calls, 'cause no one wants to hear my voice
I miss the days when I was gettin' texts that I could just avoid
And I've been trying to be calm and not preemptively destroyed
I wonder who here really loves me or who wants to be employed
Every time I'm in the real world, I just end up paranoid

I stay at home all by my lonesome with my little baby boy
And I watch him on the kitchen floor, he's playing with his toys
And I don't ever wanna leave him, but I don't think it's my choice
So, I'm basking in these moments where I feel a shred of joy
But I don't think my pleads are heard
Because I'm screamin' in the void
I'm screamin'

Please God, oh, you've gotta be sick
Why do you make it hurt and why's it over so quick?
Please God, I'm finally loved
I finally found somebody I don't want to get rid of

Please God, is it busy up there?
You took a little while to respond to my prayer
Please God, no, this doesn't seem fair
I'm trying not to show it but I'm terribly scared

Please God or whoever you are
Please God or whoever you are
Please God or whoever you are
