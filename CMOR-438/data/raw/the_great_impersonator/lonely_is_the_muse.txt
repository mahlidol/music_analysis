I spent years becoming cool
And in one single second you can make a decade of my efforts disappear
I'm just waiting at the bar and you rip open all my scars
By saying something like, "Didn't know you were here"

I always knew I was a martyr and that Jesus was one too
But I was built from special pieces that I learned how to unscrew
And I can always reassemble to fit perfectly for you
Or anybody that decides that I'm of use

Lonely is the muse
Ah-ah
Lonely is the muse

So, where do I go in the process when I'm just an apparatus?
I've inspired platinum records, I've earned platinum airline status
And I've mined a couple diamonds from the stories in my head
But I'm reduced to just a body here in someone else's bed

I always knew I was a martyr and that Jesus was one too
But I was built from special pieces that I learned how to unscrew
And I can always reassemble to fit perfectly for you
Or anybody that decides that I'm of use

Lonely is the muse
Ah-ah
Lonely is the muse
Ah-ah

And I will always be a martyr, I will fill your life with sounds
I'll be a wind chime in the window, catching light to throw around
And I will tear apart your bedroom, I'll call you in the night
I will exist in every second just to decorate your life

And when you're done you can discard me like the others always do
And I will nurse my wounds until another artist needs me new

And I will always reassemble to fit perfectly in view
For anybody that decides that I'm of use

Lonely is the muse
Ah-ah
Lonely is the muse
Ah-ah
Lonely is the muse

Lonely and forgotten is the—
