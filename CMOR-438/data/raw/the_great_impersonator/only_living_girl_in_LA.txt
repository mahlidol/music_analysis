I'm the only girl alive in L.A. County
I'm the only one who sees
I wake up every day in some new kind of suffering
I've never known a day of peace
I wonder if I ever left behind my body
Do you think they'd laugh at how I died?
Or take a photo of my family in the lobby?
The ceremony's small in size
'Cause I don't know if I could sell out my own funeral
At least, not at this point in time

And if I ever try to leave behind my body
Well, at least I know it was never mine, it was never mine
It was never mine
It was never mine

Well, I'm the only girl alive in New York City
I left my wallet on the train
Since I no longer even have a driver's license
I guess that means I have no name
And I could run away to somewhere on the West Coast
And finally be a real life girl
They'll take my organs and they'll hang me from a bed post
Saying I was too soft for this world
And they'd be right because, quite frankly, to be alive, it shouldn't kill me every day
The way it does
I don't know what I did to have this this fate
I'm drenched in it
And I can't even run from what I know

My special talent isn't writing, it's not singing
It's feeling everything that everyone alive feels every day
Feels every day
Feels every day
Feels every day

I think I'm special 'cause I cut myself wide open
As if it's honorable to bleed
But I'm not lucky and I know I wasn't chosen
The world keeps spinning without me
I told my mother I would die by twenty-seven
And in a way, I sorta did

This thing I love has grown demanding and obsessive
And it wants more than I can give, than I can give
Than I can give
Than I can give

Well, I'm the only girl alive in L.A. County
I've never known a day of peace
I wake up every day and wish that I was different
I look around and it's just me

It's just me, it's just me

I'm the only one, the only one is me
