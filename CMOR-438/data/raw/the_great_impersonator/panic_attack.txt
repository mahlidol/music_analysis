Ha, ha-ha, ha, ha-ha
Ha, ha-ha, ha, ha-ha
Ha, ha-ha

My body carries sadness that my brain cannot yet see
And I've been holding on to memories in my stomach and my teeth
And both my shoulders have been burdened by the weight of my mistakes
And every time you lean in closer, both my knees can't help but shake

And I think you're a danger to my health, or so it seems

Is it love or a panic attack?
Is a heavy heart too much to hold?
I don't know, but it's late, so I'm taking you home
Is it love or a panic attack?
Would you mind if I asked you on the phone?
I don't know, but it's late, so I'm taking you home

I had to call the doctor, left a note on his machine
Because I tripped when we went walking, and I felt it in my spleen
Now I think I need a blood test or an antihistamine
Because you make me fucking nervous, and I don't know what it all means

And I think you're a danger to my health, or so it seems

Is it love or a panic attack?
Is a heavy heart too much to hold?
I don't know, but it's late, so I'm taking you home
Is it love or a panic attack?
Would you mind if I asked you on the phone?
I don't know, but it's late, so I'm taking you home

My spirit has been broken
My optimism's getting sore
And I would love to love you
But my body's keeping score
And I don't know if I can see you anymore

Is it love? Is it love?
Is it love? Is it love? Is it love?
Is it love? Is it love?
Is it love? Is it love?

Is it love or a panic attack?
Is a heavy heart too much to hold?
I don't know, but it's late, so I'm taking you home
Is it love or a panic attack?
Would you mind if I asked you on the phone?
I don't know, but it's late, so I'm taking you home
