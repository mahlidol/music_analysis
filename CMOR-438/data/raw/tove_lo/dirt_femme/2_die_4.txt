You don't look like in your photo
You're prettier than that
Now I kinda wish that you said so
Woulda put in more effort

Man, I hope you call me, call me
'Cause I know I won't let you down
And I hope you believe, believe
I'll be here for ya, here for ya

Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
Drag you out at midnight
To dance in headlights
And making out in the rain
Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
When I think about you
The world go less blue
Let's do it over again

Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
Drag you out at midnight
To dance in headlights
And making out in the rain
Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
When I think about you
The world go less blue
Let's do it over again

I'll go on all your adventures
If you wanna find yourself
I've been to so many places
But I've never felt better

Man, I hope you call me, call me
'Cause I know I won't let you down
Man, I hope you believe this
I'll be here for ya, here for ya

Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
Drag you out at midnight
To dance in headlights
And making out in the rain
Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
When I think about you
The world go less blue
Let's do it over again

Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
Drag you out at midnight
To dance in headlights
And making out in the rain
Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
When I think about you
The world go less blue
Let's do it over again
It works

(You're to die for every day)
