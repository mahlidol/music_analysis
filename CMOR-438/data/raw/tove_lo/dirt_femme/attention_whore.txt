It gets tough out there in Hollywood
For me, in Hollywood
All those broken dreams in Hollywood
No sleep, just rendezvous

Feel the heat come off your skin
Need your eyes on me to win

I, I mind
When she looks at you in the way you look at me
Why, oh why (Why, oh why)
Do you look at her in the way you look at me?

I, I mind (I mind)
When she looks at you in the way you look at me
Why, oh why (Oh why)
Do you look at her in the way you look at me?

Yeah, the freaks like Hollywood
Yes, they do
They like the attention
I'm the new addition
Baby, wanna visit?
Yeah, I'm handsome

Can call it, but can't get too close
My homie ransom
Stop
Don't know what to say
But tell me why
You and your feelings
She been choosing all night
Now I'm on the floor and I'm next to you
Rubbing our bodies (Bodies)
Skin-tight leather (Skin-tight)
Either now or never (Never)
We should do this forever

I, I mind
When she looks at you in the way you look at me
Why, oh why (Why, oh why)
Do you look at her in the way you look at me?

I, I mind (I mind)
When she looks at you in the way you look at me
Why, oh why (Oh why)
Do you look at her in the way you look at me?

I'm an attention whore
And I want what I'm asking for (What you asking for?)
I'm an attention whore (Is that right? Is that right?)
And I want what I'm asking for (What you asking for?)
I'm an attention whore (Is that right?)
And I want what I'm asking for (What you asking for?)

I'm an attention whore
I, I mind (I mind)
When she looks at you in the way you look at me
Why, oh why (Oh why)
Do you look at her in the way you look at me?

I'm an attention whore
Attention whore
I'm an attention whore
Attention whore
