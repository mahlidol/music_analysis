I'ma tell you the truth now
'Cause I'm too high to lie
I wish I was your girlfriend
Is she with you tonight?
You say, "Sorry, I'm taken"
Walk away with a smile
I know I'm not mistaken
You're the love of my life

But you make it hard
I guess I respect that
Don't take too long
I've been waiting all night

La-la-like you, I la-la-la-like you
La-la-like you, I la-la-la-like you-ou
What do I do? There's nobody like you
La-la-like you, I la-la-la-like you-ou

I run into you everywhere
But you push me away
Does it mean you're still with her?
She convinced you to stay?
I know it's wrong, but
I cannot help it, ah-ah-ah
I know it's wrong, but
I cannot take it, ah-ah-ah

I know it's wrong, but

I, I, I like you

La-la-like you, I la-la-la-like you
La-la-like you, I la-la-la-like you-ou
What do I do? There's nobody like you
La-la-like you, I la-la-la-like you-ou (I know it's wrong, but)

La-la-like you, I la-la-la-like you
La-la-like you, I la-la-la-like you-ou
What do I do? There's nobody like you
La-la-like you, I la-la-la-like you-ou (I want you tonight)

I don't know, but
Sometimes
When you find love
The wrong thing is right
It might be hard
But worth the fight
Real love
