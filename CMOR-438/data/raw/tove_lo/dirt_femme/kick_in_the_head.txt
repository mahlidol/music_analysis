Please bring me back to life
I'm stuck too deep inside
Please take my hand
I wanna make you, mmm

Try to look fresher
Try to live better
I gotta get out of bed
I need a good kick, kick in the head

Try to lose pressure
Try to move faster
I gotta get out of bed
I need a good kick, kick in the head, uh

I know you're tired
Tired of fighting the world
I know you had it
It slipped out from under you, girl
I can't be honest
Honest isn't kind
This ain't the hardest
You'll keep on falling behind

Please bring me back to life
I'm stuck too deep inside
Please take my hand
I wanna make you everything I got
It's easier to sleep
Than let go of my dreams
Please take my hand
I wanna make you, mmm

Try to look fresher
Try to live better, uh
I gotta get out of bed
I need a good kick, kick in the head

Try to lose pressure
Try to move faster, uh
I gotta get out of bed
I need a good kick, kick in the head

My motivation
Smiling from the heart
My inspiration
It always sets foot in the dark
And I can't change it
The spiral in my mind
You are my favorite
For you, I'll pretend like I'm fine

Please bring me back to life
I'm stuck too deep inside
Please take my hand
I wanna make you everything I got
It's easier to sleep
Than let go of my dreams
Please take my hand
I wanna make you, mmm

Try to look fresher, uh
Try to live better, uh
I gotta get out of bed
I need a good kick, kick in the head

Try to lose pressure, oh yeah
Try to move faster, uh
I gotta get out of bed
I need a good kick, kick in the head, uh uh

Kick in the head, yeah
Kick in the head, I need a

Kick in the head

Mmm, uh uh
