Uh

I lift my hips, that's your go-ahead
Now wrap your lips 'round me in my bed
I prepared for tonight
Ate a pineapple slice for you

I lift my hips, that's your sexy cue
You gotta taste what's in front of you
Hold your head with my thighs
Ate a pineapple slice, ooh-ooh

Use your tongue
It turns me on
Make me moan
Your weight on me feels good

Spit and slap
I mark your back
I like that
You make my dreams come true

You say, "It's hard to find love in the club"
That's not true for the girls, we get lucky enough (Uh)

I lift my hips, that's your go-ahead (Go-ahead)
Now wrap your lips 'round me in my bed (Yeah)
I prepared for tonight (Night)
Ate a pineapple slice for you (Uh)

I lift my hips, that's your sexy cue (Sexy cue)
You gotta taste what's in front of you (Front of you)
Hold your head with my thighs (Thighs)
Ate a pineapple slice, ooh-ooh

Got you hard
Now what you want?
Just a fuck?
Or lose yourself in me?
Feel my curves
They make you hurt
You deserve
To fill me up endlessly

You say, "It's hard to find love in the club"
That's not true for the girls, we get lucky enough (Uh)

I lift my hips, that's your go-ahead (Go-ahead)
Now wrap your lips 'round me in my bed (Yeah)
I prepared for tonight (Night)
Ate a pineapple slice for you (Uh)

I lift my hips, that's your sexy cue (Sexy cue)
You gotta taste what's in front of you (In front of you)
Hold your head with my thighs (Thighs)
Ate a pineapple slice, ooh-ooh
