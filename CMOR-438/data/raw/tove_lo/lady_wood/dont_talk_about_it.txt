Golden tables, broken mirrors, naked girls around
Young and scared of love affairs so keep your conscience down
The world is beautiful, believe it with another line
Keep it up, if you're lucky enough
You know you're winnin' at life

Piles of paper gonna make 'em roll around in it
Watch it dripping from her lips
And wash your sins with it
Know it's hazy, but amazing
Yeah, you like that shit
Keep it up, if you're lucky enough
You know you're winnin' at life

Safe with me
Move so free
Silently

Don't talk about it
Sweep it under the rug like we do, do
Don't talk about it
If you're sitting with us, then you're in too
We don't talk about it
Your medallion's blindin' your mind too
Know you're loving the highs
You get in-between the lines of a life you don't need

Don't talk about it
Sweep it under the rug like we do, do
Don't talk about it
If you're sitting with us, then you're in too
We don't talk about it
Your medallion's blindin' your mind too
Know you're loving the highs
You get in-between the lines of a life you don't need

Pretty faces, put in place
To match the scenery
Take our pics. It's like a fix for your anxiety
The world is beautiful, so why don't you feel anything?
Keep it up, when you gettin' that rush
You know you cash your way out

Safe with me
Move so free
Silently

Don't talk about it
Sweep it under the rug like we do, do
Don't talk about it
If you're sitting with us, then you're in too
We don't talk about it
Your medallion's blindin' your mind too
Know you're loving the highs
You get in-between the lines of a life you don't need

Don't talk about it
Sweep it under the rug like we do, do
Don't talk about it
If you're sitting with us, then you're in too
We don't talk about it
Your medallion's blindin' your mind too
Know you're loving the highs
You get in-between the lines of a life you don't need

(Pushing, pulling)
(Pushing, pulling 'til we die)
(Pushing, pulling)
(Pushing, pulling 'til we die)
We can take perfect pictures
(Pushing, pulling)
We can take perfect pictures all night
(Pushing, pulling 'til we die)
We can take perfect pictures
(Pushing, pulling)
We can take perfect pictures all night
(Pushing, pulling 'til we die)
You better keep a straight face 'fore the camera flashes
But you're fucked

Don't talk about it
Sweep it under the rug like we do, do
Don't talk about it
If you're sitting with us, then you're in too
We don't talk about it
Your medallion's blindin' your mind too
Know you're loving the highs
You get in-between the lines of a life you don't need

Don't talk about it
Sweep it under the rug like we do, do
Don't talk about it
If you're sitting with us, then you're in too
We don't talk about it
Your medallion's blindin' your mind too
Know you're loving the highs
You get in-between the lines of a life you don't need
