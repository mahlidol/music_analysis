Just because I'm present
Don't mean I forgot about you back home
You think I'm surrounded
But, babe, I do most of this alone

People come, I push them away
People talk, I know what they say
People come, I push them away
People talk, I know what they say
What about you?

When I fuck things up
When I fuck things up in front of camera flashes
What about you?
When all I built up
When all I built up with sweat, blood, tears just crashes
What about you?
What about you?

"Money is a problem"
You say in a way like I'm to blame (Yeah)
I don't really need them
All I want is for us to stay the same
What about you?

People come, I push them away
People talk, I know what they say
People come, I push them away
People talk, I know what they say
What about ya?

When I fuck things up
When I fuck things up in front of camera flashes
What about you?
When all I built up
When all I built up with sweat, blood, tears just crashes
What about you?
What about you?

What about you?
What about you? Oh

Ah, yeah, oh, what about you?
Oh, yeah, nah, when I fuck things up, yeah
What? Yeah, fuck things up, what about you?
Oh, what about you? (Fuck things up, yeah)

(When I fuck things up)
Fuck things up
(All of these flashes)
Coming over me
(All of these flashes)
What about you?
(All of these flashes)
Coming over me
When I fuck things up
In front of camera flashes
(All of these flashes)
What about you?
When all I built up (Oh)
With sweat, blood, tears just crashes
What about you?
When I fuck things up, yeah
