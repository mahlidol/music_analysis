So you fought off a thousand gangsters ready for the war
And you hang with The Stones 'round the world on tour
And you bought me a million diamonds, but lost them by the shore
'Cause if I'd to believe you, I'd look in the water

And the wide-eyed loving monster who feeds my every lie
'Cause I need to pretend it's you and I
And I know my head is twisted, but it keeps me sane at times
That I know I can keep you in my mind

Dream 'til I'm dead, then set me on fire
Flames and the smoke keep taking me higher
Love and pretend we'll soon be expired
We would be not made for this world
Not made for this world

So I tell you a little secret, who knew that I could fly?
I'm the queen of the world in the trees up high
And if you wanna come with me, you just say the word
I'll be waving my wand, then we both turn into birds

You're the wide-eyed loving monster who feeds my every lie
'Cause I need to pretend it's you and I

Dream 'til I'm dead, then set me on fire
Flames and the smoke keep taking me higher
Love and pretend we'll soon be expired
We would be not made for this world
Not made for this world

We got a happy place where nobody else can go
You and I

Dream 'til I'm dead, then set me on fire
Flames and the smoke keep taking me higher
Love and pretend we'll soon be expired
(And we were not made for this)
We would be not made for this world

Dream 'til I'm dead, then set me on fire
Flames and the smoke keep taking me higher
Love and pretend we'll soon be expired
(And we were not made for this world)
We would be not made for this world
Not made for this world
Not made for this world
Not made for this world
We would be not made for this world
