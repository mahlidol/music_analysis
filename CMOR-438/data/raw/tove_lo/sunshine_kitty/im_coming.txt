Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

The night's still young, I lay wide awake now (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I'm Lucy in the Sky, I'm Queen of the Clouds (Queen of the 'Clouds)
Yeah, I know she's cute but please, baby, hold out (Oh-oh)
'Cause I've fallen hard, fell so hard that I woke up (Oh-oh)
Yeah, I know she's cute but please, baby, hold out

'Cause I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming
I am almost there
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming now
Hold out, you know that
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming
Baby, I think I'm in love
The taxi, the hallway, the elevator, staircase
Falling, falling

You and me now (Now, now, oh-oh)
Please, baby, please just wait, hold out (Oh-oh)
Fifteen thousand feet up in the air, I see it all so clear
I know she's cute, but it needs to be you and me
You and me

'Cause I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming
I am almost there
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming now
Hold out, you know that
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming
Baby, I think I'm in love (I think I'm in love)
The taxi, the hallway, the elevator, staircase
Falling, I'm falling

Falling down, hm (Falling)
I'm falling down (Yeah, falling)

'Cause I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming
I am almost there
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming now
Hold out, you know that
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming
Baby, I think I'm in love (I think I'm in love)
The taxi, the hallway, the elevator, staircase
Falling, I'm falling
