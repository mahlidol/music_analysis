Perfect petals punctuate the fabrics yellow blue
Silver platters with strawberries strewn across the room

In Zimmerman with sandals on one summer dress to choose

Three girls
Eyes rolled
Loud laughter
Dust specs lit by afternoon

My life is sweet like lemonade now there's no bitter fruit
Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind
No thought of you

My thoughts have changed
My voice is higher
Now I'm over you

No flickering in my head movies
Projected in Bellevue

Because I captured the mood of my wish fulfilled
And sailed to Xanadu

The grief that came in waves that rolled I navigated through

The fire from my wish as wind to future trip to Malibu

Now everything I have is perfect
Nothing much to do

Just perfect florals
Green embroidered chairs
One dress to choose
